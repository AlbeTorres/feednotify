          "content:encodedSnippet": "Hello there, PlayStation fans!\nThat’s no moon over the Battle Royale Island — it’s a whole Star Wars Season! Also, the celebration is just getting started in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life. Over in LEGO Fortnite Odyssey, explore and battle for galactic supremacy. The fun continues in Rocket League with the new 2v2 Car Wars LTM.\nThere’s a lot to unpack, but don’t worry — these are the updates you’re looking for! Let’s dive in with what’s happening across Epic Games, starting with Fortnite Battle Royale. \nA shadow emerges in Battle Royale\nImperial Star Destroyers exit hyperspace in formation around the Death Star, which looms with its superlaser array fixed on the BR map. Heroes from across eras are ready to strike back against the assault led by Emperor Palpatine from the shadows, and the Island’s fate hangs in the balance. Draw your lightsaber and ready your blaster May 2 in Fortnite: Galactic Battle!\nNew places to see, returning weapons to loot\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPlay  Video\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\nDriving back the Imperial invasion will take every blaster and ship at your disposal and these new locations will help you do just that! The First Order Base, Outpost Enclave, Resistance Base, and Vader Samuari’s Solitude are all primed and ready for exploration (and looting!). Just be mindful, you never know who you’ll run into.\n\n\n\n\nThe preferred weapon of Force users everywhere\nAn elegant weapon for a more civilized age, the use of a lightsaber is the mark of a Jedi, though it’s also used by their sworn enemies, the Sith. Lightsabers are exceptionally handy for deflecting blaster bolts, and wielding one will allow you to sprint faster, jump twice as high, and have immunity to fall damage. You’ll have to prove yourself to earn one, though… Or just loot it off another player.\n\n\n\n\nHow to prove yourself? Train with hologramic followers of both the light and dark sides to unlock their respective lightsaber and Force Ability. Force Push, Force Lightning, and Force Saber Throw are the Force Abilities you can learn day one, with more becoming learnable later in the Season!\nSo anyway, start blasting\nAs far as non-lightsaber weapons go, it’s blasters-only on day one, with the exception of the Thermal Imploder that’ll cause a blast in its own way. You’ve got your DL-44 Blaster Pistol, ACP Scatter Blaster, E-11 Blaster, and several more.\nBe careful about holding down the trigger, as these babies are prone to overheating!\n\n\n\n\nLooking to dogfight for your next Victory Royale? Pilot the Imperial TIE fighter equipped with high-powered blasters or the nimble X-wing and take to the skies!\n\n\n\n\nWeekly updates\nMay 8 – The pull of the Force\nSensing a disturbance in the Force, Leia and Luke will arrive on the Island alongside renowned smuggler Han Solo to offer you strategic services!\n\n\n\n\nAlso, train with hologram Mace Windu to earn a Purple Lightsaber and be taught Force Pull. Pull in just about anything and anyone nearby with this Force Ability.\nRumor has it that Sith Lord Darth Maul will also appear as a hologram, offering Red Lightsabers and teaching Force Throw, which allows you to throw nearby objects as projectiles…  \nMay 15 – Chew on this\nChewbacca arrives and he’s bringing his Wookiee Bowcaster to the loot pool to aid the rebels. You’ll also find the new, powerful CA-87 Jawa Scatter Blaster in Chests around the Island!\n\n\n\n\nMay 22 – Mandalorian Rising\nMandalorians will intervene this week. Recruit a Heavy, Scout, Supply, or Medic Mandalorian to your team, and gain further advantage over your opponents with the unvaulted Mandalorian Jetpack! \nAlso, keep an eye out for signature Mandalorian weapons: the Amban Sniper Rifle and the new dual-wield WESTAR-34 Blaster Pistols. \nMay 29 – Star Destroyer bombardment\nBe the first to reach the control room of a Star Destroyer which spawns every match. Assume control of its turbolaser to lay waste from above!\n\n\n\n\nJune 7 – The final showdown: Death Star sabotage\nMobilize and take the fight to Emperor Palpatine in a live, in-game narrative event on June 7. Never tell me the odds.\nGet the Star Wars Battle Pass\nThe Star Wars Battle Pass is full of treasures from across the known galaxy. The Star Wars Battle Pass has both free and premium rewards that can be claimed by earning XP in any Fortnite experience. Here are the Outfits in the Pass, available as premium rewards:\nApprentice Evie: Force-sensitive vigilante spreading peace across the Galaxy. (Automatically unlocked after purchasing the Pass or accessing it through Fortnite Crew!)\nPoe Dameron: The finest pilot in the Resistance.\nWookiee Team Leader: Growl it out.\nEmperor Palpatine: Leader of the Empire. Ruler of the galaxy.\n\n\n\n\nKaleesh cyborg and General of the Separatist droid army, General Grievous will be a premium Outfit in the Star Wars Battle Pass later in May. Unlock Grievous by completing objectives that’ll come online further in the Season! The Pass will be available to progress in from May 2 until the Galactic Battle ends on June 7, 2025 Eastern Time.\nMore fun begins in LEGO Fortnite\nCelebrate the most intergalactic time of year in LEGO Fortnite Brick Life’s Star Wars Festival, where you can grab a bite in the Durrr Burger Cantina, score goals in Death Star Soccer Ball, hang out with a Porg, and even acquire your very own Lightsaber Bench. This gathering for Star Wars fans everywhere will be going on from May 2 until June 8, 2025 Eastern Time.\n\n\n\n\nIn a galaxy just next door, LEGO Fortnite Odyssey is launching a public matchmaking test on May 15 called Rapid Survival — an eight-player public world survival experience on the existing Star Wars Island. \nLoad in with a pre-determined loadout that includes a Lightsaber, Macrobinoculars, a plethora of building materials, and more to aid in your journey. Even though PvP combat is on, you can also choose to team up against the Star Wars enemies! \n\n\n\n\nHeads-up: Rapid Survival will be open at specific four-hour windows from May 15 until May 26 Eastern Time. \nFirst Order LEGO Pass\nThe ruthless Captain Phasma Outfit is front and center as a premium reward in the First Order LEGO Pass, available starting May 2! There’s even more precious cargo you can unlock like the premium First Order Base Build, First Order AT-AT Build, Lil’ Treadspeeder Emote, and a lot more. \nThe First Order LEGO Pass will be available to progress in until June 8 Eastern Time, with free and premium rewards unlockable by earning XP in any Fortnite experience. Captain Phasma is automatically unlocked after purchasing the Pass or accessing it through Fortnite Crew!\n\n\n\n\nShift into Hyperspace as Star Wars and Rocket League cross over once again\nLeading the charge in Rocket League is Car Wars, a brand new Limited Time Mode that’ll require you to channel your inner TIE pilot for any hope of victory! Also, look forward to Star Wars Challenges rewarding imperial items like the Stormtrooper Octane Decal and TIE Fighter Topper. Rocket League x Star Wars runs from May 2 at 12 PM ET to May 16, 2025, at 12 PM ET!\n\n\n\n\nDark Side of the Force = Unnatural Abilities in LTMs\nCar Wars (May 2 at 12 PM ET – May 14 at 12 PM ET)\nThe 2v2 Car Wars takes place at the Force Field Arena, a Star Wars-inspired twist on the Arena used for Rocket Labs’ Loophole. Target the thermal exhaust ports at each end of the Arena to score and use the lightsaber-fied Spike Rush mutator to hit your mark.\n\n\n\n\nG-Force Frenzy (May 2 at 12 PM ET to May 7 at 12 PM ET)\nDebuting in last year’s Mandalorian Mayhem event, G-Force Frenzy returns this year! This is a 3v3 mode that lets you unleash unlimited boost, cranked to five times standard power. Navigate the arena faster than the Millennium Falcon on the Kessel Run!\n\n\n\n\nSwear allegiance to the Empire with new Challenges\n\n\n\n\nTen new items are yours to earn by completing Star Wars Challenges! Claim  antagonistic accessories like the Stormtrooper Octane Decal, Stormtrooper Helmet Topper, TIE Fighter Topper, Force Lightning Boost, and more.",

I’m Graeme Timmins, Creative Director at Gearbox Entertainment—and today, the team and I are thrilled to give you our deepest ever look at some explosive, carnage-filled gameplay, all running on PlayStation 5 Pro. We’re showing off two of our four new Vault Hunters and some of their Action Skills, intense looter shooter gameplay with details on all kinds of new gear, the deadly regions you’ll explore on the all-new planet Kairos, and much more.\nFollowing the cataclysm seen in our teaser trailer and the contentious clash of our First Look trailer, the tyrannical Timekeeper is here to admonish us as we meet our four new Vault Hunters in this pulse-pounding Gameplay Trailer:\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPlay  Video\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\nEver since Gearbox created the looter shooter genre nearly 16 years ago, we’ve continued to refine the formula, delivering more loot and action with every entry. I’ve worked on every mainline Borderlands game since starting out as Lead Level Designer on the original Borderlands, and my Gameplay Deep Dive co-op buddy Anthony Nicholson, Senior Project Producer on Borderlands 4, has been with the series since Borderlands 2. With Borderlands 4, we truly believe that this team is creating the best, most ambitious Borderlands game to date.\nThis all-new adventure is the perfect entry point for new players—and for existing players, you’ll find the awesome gameplay you know and love cranked up to 11, with new movement abilities, our biggest and baddest enemies yet, a vast new planet to explore, and of course, billions of guns to loot. \n\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPlay  Video\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\t\nWreak havoc as a Vault Hunter\nThe Borderlands games are set in an unforgiving sci-fi universe, where life is cheap and guns are plentiful. You play as a Vault Hunter, a badass mercenary on the hunt for alien Vaults, wielding wild guns and devastating abilities. In the Gameplay Deep Dive, we’re showing off two of our four all-new Vault Hunters: Vex the Siren, who uses supernatural phase energy to empower herself and can conjure deadly minions, and Rafa the Exo-Soldier, a former Tediore trooper who wears an experimental exo-suit capable of digistructing an arsenal of weapons. Personally, I’m a huge fan of Vex’s spectral feline familiar Trouble, who can absolutely maul any enemies that try to attack my flank during a shootout.\nEach Vault Hunter class in Borderlands 4 offers a unique playstyle that empowers you to choose from three signature abilities that serve as your Action Skills. We’re delivering our most advanced skill tree system yet, letting you enhance your Action Skills with special augments and capstone abilities. You can choose from three branching paths of passive abilities that enable an incredibly wide variety of distinctly powerful builds. \n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tView and download image\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\nclose\n\t\n\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDownload this image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nEach Vault Hunter also has a unique Trait that shapes their playstyle; for instance, Vex’s Trait makes her Action Skills attune to the element of the weapon she currently has equipped, incentivizing an arsenal of elemental weapons to shock, burn, or freeze enemies based on the situation.\nOne of our guiding design principles for our Vault Hunters is that playing as them should make you feel like an unstoppable force on the battlefield, that unleashes Action Skills to control the flow of combat and blast through enemies with an arsenal of outrageous weaponry. You can also flex even more skill expression during battle with a wide range of new movement abilities, including gliding, dashing, double-jumping, and point-grappling.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tView and download image\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\nclose\n\t\n\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDownload this image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nWelcome to Kairos\nIn Borderlands 4, we’re dropping you into the middle of Kairos, an all-new planet rife with warring factions, deadly fauna, and desperate inhabitants. For thousands of years, the oppressive Timekeeper kept the planet hidden, controlling its inhabitants with cybernetic implants called Bolts and an army of synthetic soldiers known as The Order.\nBut six years before the events of Borderlands 4, a rogue moon suddenly teleported into Kairos’ orbit, shattering the planet’s protective veil and plunging the world into chaos. Now the denizens of Kairos have started rising up, with some even ripping their Bolts right out of their skulls. That’s the situation our four Vault Hunters have crash-landed into: a planet with a population primed to explode, and you’re the spark.\nIn your quest to ignite a revolution against the Timekeeper, you’ll meet unique factions that you’ll need to recruit to your cause, including a slew of new characters and some returning faces that’ll be instantly familiar to Borderlands fans. We’re delighted to be bringing back fan-favorite characters like Claptrap, Moxxi, and Zane—but we’re also so excited for you to meet some of the charming allies and loathsome adversaries that await you on Kairos.\nTo help you get around Kairos’ sprawling, seamlessly connected spaces, you can now summon a personalized Digirunner vehicle at will and jet-boost your way towards the horizon. We’ve built a world that exudes craftsmanship and encourages you to explore it at your own pace—with the option for guidance provided by your ECHO-4 robot buddy—as you take on new enemies, encounter world events, and discover hidden treasures.\nFrom Order patrols to world bosses, there’s always something to shoot and loot as you explore Kairos. You’ll also come across short gameplay experiences and new activities that auto-grant a tracked mission whenever you discover them—like Silos, which house old, decommissioned Order tech that you can hijack for the Crimson Resistance with the help of ECHO-4. \nOnce you’ve reclaimed a Silo, it will reveal the approximate location of a Vault Key Fragment. Collect enough fragments and you’ll unlock a hidden Vault—a high level dungeon with challenging combat and serious loot. Reclaimed Silos can also be used as Fast Travel points, or you can zipline up their hacked communications balloon to start gliding through the air towards your next objective.\nWreaking havoc across Kairos is awesome alone and even better with friends—which is why we’ve made it easier than ever to jump into co-op multiplayer, whether through 2-player splitscreen or via our improved lobby system with drop-in/drop-out action for up to 4 players online, with full crossplay at launch.* Borderlands 4 is designed for co-op from the ground up, with instanced loot for each player, dynamic level scaling, individual difficulty settings, and the option to Fast Travel directly to other players to keep the party together and having fun through the whole campaign.\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tView and download image\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\nclose\n\t\n\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDownload this image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nGearing up for a fight\nIn the new gameplay footage, you can watch us go on the offensive across the Terminus Range, where one of the Timekeeper’s generals, Vile Lictor, has been conducting nefarious experiments.

And with it comes a whole paddock of improvements, tweaks, and new features to ensure unfamiliar racers and track veterans alike all feel at home. I recently had an opportunity to talk with the developers at EA Codemasters about the upcoming racing game’s newest gameplay features.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp class=\"\"\u003E“We’re never short of feedback,” says EA Codemasters’ Creative Director Gavin Cooper. “We listen to the community and that informs a lot of our features this year.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp class=\"\"\u003EThe wealth of voices offering reactions over the figurative team radio don’t just include the official forums and other close sources, but also Esports drivers and content creators who had the opportunity to get their hands on&nbsp; F1 25, early during its development.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp class=\"\"\u003EThe result is a game which has aimed to sharpen up everything from its car handling, to a glossier TV-style presentation, and enhanced real driver voice over. “Hearing the real drivers’ voices as you&#8217;re playing really brings a degree of authenticity to the experience,” says Gavin. “We’ve got almost double the number of voice lines in F1 25 that we had in F1 24, and you experience them in more context, too.” So not only can you hear directly from some of the principals, you’ll also have back and forth exchanges between the real drivers and the in-game race engineers, offering the sort of camaraderie – and tension – of the real thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp class=\"\"\u003EGavin is also keen to point out that for fans who were frustrated with the samey engine noises in the comprehensive My Team mode, that bugbear has been addressed. “You&#8217;re now able to attach the correct audio to the different engine suppliers &#8211; so depending on which supplier you pick, it&#8217;ll actually make your car sound different. That&#8217;s something I know people have wanted for a long time.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EYour very own dream team\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp class=\"\"\u003EOn the subject of My Team, the popular mode has received a significant boost, designed to get fans’ hearts racing. This time, rather than being the owner-driver, you’re now the team owner having to manage a pair of drivers. “We know being an owner-driver is not authentic to the sport,” says Gavin. “But now having to manage two drivers opens up a lot of interesting decisions for the player. Previously whenever we’ve asked you to prioritise one driver over the other it wasn’t an interesting choice – you’d naturally choose yourself. Now you have to think about who&#8217;s the most important in things like contract negotiation and upgrades.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp class=\"\"\u003EWhile you’ll choose who to control on the track itself during race weekends, managing two different personalities and egos offers more complexity to juggle, on top of running the detailed Engineering, Personnel and Corporate facilities, which can also spill out into how your team, competitors and prospects perceive you. Even when added to the expanded R&#038;D and sponsor systems which interact with perks, upgrades, and relationships, and increased control over Driver Icons to allow AI teams to recruit iconic drivers, it’s still only a selection of the additions you’ll have at your racing gloved fingertips.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBraking Point drives the narrative experience forward\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp class=\"\"\u003EFans of Braking Point, F1’s massive story mode series, aren’t left on the starting grid, either. “We’re always looking for ways to increase the players’ impact on the narrative,” says Gavin. So now when key events happen, you have the option to choose from the two Konnersport drivers available in that scenario, resulting in various ripple effects which can not only impact some of the race objectives, but also the end of the story itself. Implementing this expansion and various branching narratives was no small task for the development team.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp class=\"\"\u003E“We’re keeping track of the core narrative, which is supported by various other threads, subplots, and other little storylines that we deliver through the secondary narrative, like phone calls, social media and news posts,” explains Gavin. “And those different threads might be more relevant to one driver but can come back and intersect with the main story. So it’s making sure you&#8217;re still getting something that feels specific to that driver and the storylines that you’re engaging with, and still have a coherent overall narrative that everyone can enjoy. It’s difficult, but it&#8217;s been a really fun process as well.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp class=\"\"\u003EAnd when you finish Braking Point? Well, there’s a special bonus that will allow you to bring your Konnersport team directly into the Career Mode, for the first time in the series. It’s just one of the many ways F1 25 has stepped up a gear to give you a variety of flexibility in how you want to race.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp class=\"\"\u003E“There&#8217;s a whole matrix of possibilities you can pursue in the game,” says Gavin.&nbsp; “You can play as an official driver, or a custom driver, but there’s also kinda an 11th team, via Konnersport or Apex. Do you still play as a custom driver on an official team, or go for an official driver? And that’s all before you even get into bringing Icons into My Team, too.”\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped

          "content:encodedSnippet": "The buzz of excitement is ramping up into a full roar as EA Sports F1 25 gets ready for lights out on May 30. And with it comes a whole paddock of improvements, tweaks, and new features to ensure unfamiliar racers and track veterans alike all feel at home. I recently had an opportunity to talk with the developers at EA Codemasters about the upcoming racing game’s newest gameplay features.\n“We’re never short of feedback,” says EA Codemasters’ Creative Director Gavin Cooper. “We listen to the community and that informs a lot of our features this year.”\nThe wealth of voices offering reactions over the figurative team radio don’t just include the official forums and other close sources, but also Esports drivers and content creators who had the opportunity to get their hands on  F1 25, early during its development.\nThe result is a game which has aimed to sharpen up everything from its car handling, to a glossier TV-style presentation, and enhanced real driver voice over. “Hearing the real drivers’ voices as you’re playing really brings a degree of authenticity to the experience,” says Gavin. “We’ve got almost double the number of voice lines in F1 25 that we had in F1 24, and you experience them in more context, too.” So not only can you hear directly from some of the principals, you’ll also have back and forth exchanges between the real drivers and the in-game race engineers, offering the sort of camaraderie – and tension – of the real thing.\nGavin is also keen to point out that for fans who were frustrated with the samey engine noises in the comprehensive My Team mode, that bugbear has been addressed. “You’re now able to attach the correct audio to the different engine suppliers – so depending on which supplier you pick, it’ll actually make your car sound different. That’s something I know people have wanted for a long time.”\nYour very own dream team\nOn the subject of My Team, the popular mode has received a significant boost, designed to get fans’ hearts racing. This time, rather than being the owner-driver, you’re now the team owner having to manage a pair of drivers. “We know being an owner-driver is not authentic to the sport,” says Gavin. “But now having to manage two drivers opens up a lot of interesting decisions for the player. Previously whenever we’ve asked you to prioritise one driver over the other it wasn’t an interesting choice – you’d naturally choose yourself. Now you have to think about who’s the most important in things like contract negotiation and upgrades.”\nWhile you’ll choose who to control on the track itself during race weekends, managing two different personalities and egos offers more complexity to juggle, on top of running the detailed Engineering, Personnel and Corporate facilities, which can also spill out into how your team, competitors and prospects perceive you. Even when added to the expanded R&D and sponsor systems which interact with perks, upgrades, and relationships, and increased control over Driver Icons to allow AI teams to recruit iconic drivers, it’s still only a selection of the additions you’ll have at your racing gloved fingertips.\nBraking Point drives the narrative experience forward\nFans of Braking Point, F1’s massive story mode series, aren’t left on the starting grid, either. “We’re always looking for ways to increase the players’ impact on the narrative,” says Gavin. So now when key events happen, you have the option to choose from the two Konnersport drivers available in that scenario, resulting in various ripple effects which can not only impact some of the race objectives, but also the end of the story itself. Implementing this expansion and various branching narratives was no small task for the development team.\n“We’re keeping track of the core narrative, which is supported by various other threads, subplots, and other little storylines that we deliver through the secondary narrative, like phone calls, social media and news posts,” explains Gavin. “And those different threads might be more relevant to one driver but can come back and intersect with the main story. So it’s making sure you’re still getting something that feels specific to that driver and the storylines that you’re engaging with, and still have a coherent overall narrative that everyone can enjoy. It’s difficult, but it’s been a really fun process as well.”\nAnd when you finish Braking Point? Well, there’s a special bonus that will allow you to bring your Konnersport team directly into the Career Mode, for the first time in the series. It’s just one of the many ways F1 25 has stepped up a gear to give you a variety of flexibility in how you want to race.\n“There’s a whole matrix of possibilities you can pursue in the game,” says Gavin.  “You can play as an official driver, or a custom driver, but there’s also kinda an 11th team, via Konnersport or Apex. Do you still play as a custom driver on an official team, or go for an official driver? And that’s all before you even get into bringing Icons into My Team, too.”\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tView and download image\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\nclose\n\t\n\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDownload this image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tView and download image\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\nclose\n\t\n\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDownload this image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tView and download image\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\nclose\n\t\n\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDownload this image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tView and download image\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\nclose\n\t\n\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDownload this image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tView and download image\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\nclose\n\t\n\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDownload this image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tView and download image\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\t\nclose\n\t\n\t\t\t\tClose\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDownload this image\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\nImmersive details at every turn\nAs in-depth as many of the existing modes go, the development team haven’t forgotten about the fun little extras, either.

Today, we released a new major content update, which went to some surprising places. Before talking about what’s new in the update, I think it is important to go back about a year and talk about the initial release of \u003Cem\u003EEverafter Falls\u003C/em\u003E. And just to introduce myself: I’m Joseph\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EShockley, otherwise known as Riv Otter, the Community Manager for Akupara Games.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EEverafter Falls\u003C/em\u003E is the first farming sim we ever released, and we saw feedback from a wide variety of players. To gather feedback, I opened a channel in the \u003Cem\u003EEverafter Falls\u003C/em\u003E Discord where people could discuss, suggest, and see the thoughts of what other players were after. I also kept an eye on the Steam forums and stayed active in them to show that we care about their feedback and that we will take it seriously. Because \u003Cem\u003EEverafter Falls \u003C/em\u003Ewas developed by just one developer, we knew that getting insight from players was going to be core to the game’s release.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"\u003E\u003Cimg fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/EAF_2.0_Terrariums-89eb5b4b031ba6d62220.jpg\" alt=\"Everafter screenshoit\" class=\"wp-image-208838\" srcset=\"https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/EAF_2.0_Terrariums-89eb5b4b031ba6d62220.jpg 1280w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/EAF_2.0_Terrariums-89eb5b4b031ba6d62220-768x432.jpg 768w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/EAF_2.0_Terrariums-89eb5b4b031ba6d62220-1024x576.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOur first surprise came from the completionists in the community. They talked about how hard and frustrating it is to collect every item and raise every insect to finish out the journal. There wasn’t a way to improve your chances of finding what you needed, so the more players put hours into collection, the harder it became to clear out every last item.

          "content:encodedSnippet": "When Everafter Falls was released almost a year ago, we always knew that the game was going to be changing – what we didn’t know was how different it would look after talking with our players. Today, we released a new major content update, which went to some surprising places. Before talking about what’s new in the update, I think it is important to go back about a year and talk about the initial release of Everafter Falls. And just to introduce myself: I’m Joseph\nShockley, otherwise known as Riv Otter, the Community Manager for Akupara Games.\nEverafter Falls is the first farming sim we ever released, and we saw feedback from a wide variety of players. To gather feedback, I opened a channel in the Everafter Falls Discord where people could discuss, suggest, and see the thoughts of what other players were after. I also kept an eye on the Steam forums and stayed active in them to show that we care about their feedback and that we will take it seriously. Because Everafter Falls was developed by just one developer, we knew that getting insight from players was going to be core to the game’s release.\n\n\n\n\nOur first surprise came from the completionists in the community. They talked about how hard and frustrating it is to collect every item and raise every insect to finish out the journal. There wasn’t a way to improve your chances of finding what you needed, so the more players put hours into collection, the harder it became to clear out every last item. Some people were just getting super unlucky and failing to get that missing item after retrying for hundreds of times, and there wasn’t a way to improve those odds. As soon as we noticed the bottleneck this was creating for completionist players, it was clear we needed to add something to help. In the version 2.0 patch, there are two new items that should help completionists gather the last missing items they need: \nThe Golden Shroom Terrarium: a prize item and will give you a 100% chance to get a shroom you haven’t already gotten.\nThe Epic Critter Terrarium: lets you breed only insects you haven’t currently found. \nSpecifically, creating hard-to-craft late-game chase items that can help players fill out their collections was an easy way we could answer the call for this.\n\n\n\n\nIn Everafter Falls, players can decorate their farm and house with different ornamentation. We always knew that giving players purely cosmetic options for their farms would be helpful, but the community was so excited for all the different options they had to really express their creativity in their farm. Even positive feedback can be used as a guide to improve the game in a content patch, which is why, with positive feedback on the variety of decorations that Everafter Falls had, this content update added an abundance of new adornments, and we’ve already seen players adding them to their farm and house.\n\n\n\n\nWe received a ton of feedback, which I categorized as quality of life requests.

          "content:encodedSnippet": "Summary\n\nRa Ra Boom comes to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC this summer.\nStop the threat of the rogue AI as one of four ninja space cheerleaders in a fully voiced story.\nFun new twist on classic couch co-op, including shoot ‘em up mechanics.\n\nRa Ra Boom is coming to Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One this summer, as part of what we consider the summer of beat ‘em ups. As beat ‘em up fans, we can’t wait to play some of the great titles that will make this probably the biggest year for beat ‘em ups since Castle Crashers launched forever ago.\nIf you’re a fan of beat ‘em ups, you’re in for a great summer. And we hope you consider adding Ra Ra Boom to your list of must plays.\n\n\n\n\nIn Ra Ra Boom, you and up to three friends play as one of four ninja space cheerleaders. There’s Aris (the leader), Ren (the blade), Vee (the shield), and Saida (the cyborg). Zoi, an AI gone rogue, has overtaken earth and our four heroines are the only ones who can stop it.\nBeat ‘em Up/Shoot ‘em Up Mash Up\nAs the saying goes, you don’t bring pom poms to a boss fight. So, we had to ensure our heroines were armed for the AI menace they were facing. Where most beat ‘em ups focus on melee with limited-use ranged options, we did things a little different.\n\n\n\n\nRa Ra Boom can be played as a pure beat ‘em up. Each character has their own melee attack and you can be effective with them. Or you can play it as a pure shoot ‘em up, because you also have an effective ranged attack with unlimited ammo. But it’s best to mix the two, getting into your flow and finding the attack combos that suit the moment.\nWe think that after you play Ra Ra Boom, with its speed and fluid mix of melee and ranged combat, it will be hard to go back to the standard we’ve all gotten used to.\nPlay the Lanes\nMost beat ‘em ups you’ll play today are in 2.5D, meaning that you don’t just move your character left and right, but also can move up and down on a flat plane.

It was harder than you might imagine for us to implement, but it makes a big difference in your effectiveness while giving enemies a beat down.\nFully Voiced Story\nHearing characters helps make them come to life. Whether that’s in the 2D cinematics you watch between levels, or the many quips heard while playing, you’ll get to know the personalities and quirks of our heroines.\n\n\n\n\nWe wanted to provide a meaningful story for players about four individuals thrust into an impossible situation. It’s a coming-of-age tale amidst an AI apocalypse and it was important that each hero had their own moments, so you could get to know and care about them.\nBut When Can You Get It?\nGood question.

Each encounter is a test of skill and resolve, with foes drawn from myth, history, and nightmare alike. From corrupted monks to towering beasts, every boss fight offers its own punishing challenge, rewarding players who press forward through the crumbling world of Shu.\nWith pre-orders now live on the Xbox Store and launch set for July 24, 2025, on Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC, and day one with Game Pass, you can now get a deeper glimpse of what awaits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe latest trailer highlights a fearsome showdown against the Perfect Bride, a nightmarish foe whose corrupted beauty hides monstrous power. Alongside this reveal, you can explore a full breakdown of pre-order and Deluxe Edition bonuses, featuring exclusive outfits, enchanted weapons, and gameplay-enhancing rewards that will shape your journey when Wuchang: Fallen Feathers arrives.\nMeet the Foes That Await\nBeyond every crumbling temple and bloodstained battlefield in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, terrifying foes stand between you and the truth. Each boss you encounter tells a story of decay, obsession, or betrayal — and overcoming them will be key to surviving Shu’s collapse.\n\nPerfect Bride – Fang Ling\nClad in an ornate phoenix crown and ceremonial gown, Fang Ling embodies a corrupted dream of love and legacy. Once a symbol of hope, she now haunts the land as a spectral bride twisted by Feathering, wielding deadly grace and devastating magic against all who cross her path.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaster Raider – Man-eating Dhutanga\nLeader of a ruthless gang of tomb raiders, Dhutanga carved his stronghold into the Hanguang Zen Temple. A brutal warrior with a surprising love for opera, his ceremonial robes and fearsome painted mask signal both cultural reverence and lethal cunning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeathered Priest – Lu Bingzhang\nOnce a revered priest, Lu Bingzhang now serves a darker power. His golden mask and bronze staff, inspired by the ancient relics of Sanxingdui, channel twisted sorcery drawn from forgotten gods. Defeating him will demand mastery over both blade and spirit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlightweaver – Great Centipede\nDeep beneath Shu festers the Great Centipede, a grotesque fusion of corrupted monks and mutated flesh, driven mad by Red Mercury. Able to burrow, poison, and wield spells once sacred to the monks it devoured, this abomination turns ancient knowledge into monstrous power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReborn Treant – Soulwood\nBorn from death and ritual, the Soulwood grew as corpses piled beneath the sacred Immortal Tree. Now, it roams with haunting shrines embedded in its bark, entwining the hopes, prayers, and lingering souls of a shattered town into one relentless force of nature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBo Sorcerer\nThe master of forbidden rites, capable of warping reality itself with devastating magic. Facing her is not only a test of combat skill but of mastering the battlefield before he bends it to her will.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonstrous Toddler – Bai Kru\nThe third child of Bai Tingzhao, Bai Kru has become twisted by Feathering and the ambitions of his father, he has become a nightmarish figure, an eerie blend of innocence, brutality, and tragedy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMing General – Liu Cheng’en\nA loyal eunuch to the Emperor and master manipulator, Liu Cheng is adorned in python-embroidered robes and a noble Sanshan hat, he commands authority and terror in equal measure, a final test of strength and will.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPre-Order Bonuses and Deluxe Edition Details\nThe journey through Wuchang: Fallen Feathers will test your resolve, but you can prepare to embark with greater style, deeper customization, and a more personal touch to your legend. Pre-order today to receive exclusive rewards that enrich your experience across the land of Shu.\n\n\n\n\nPre-orders will unlock two unique Enhanced Costume Sets: the White Spectre and Night Spectre, reimagining ceremonial garb into hauntingly beautiful attire that reflects the game’s dark world. In addition, the Vermillion War Club (Axe) offers a fierce new weapon to master, and the Glistening Red Mercury Skill Upgrade Item provides an early boost to help refine your character’s fighting style.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re seeking an even richer adventure, the Deluxe Edition offers an expanded array of treasures.

Playing as a fallen fighter named Alta, you’ll manage a tea shop within a magical forest and tend to the customers who pass through. But Alta does not want to be here. And if she gets her way, the tea shop will be nothing but a brief and painful memory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile this year’s Game Developers Conference was incredibly energizing and inspiring, it was also stressful and overwhelming at times. I needed a meditative escape after I got home, and \u003Cem\u003EWanderstop\u003C/em\u003E was the \u003Cem\u003Eperfect\u003C/em\u003E game to help me recharge. It’s beautiful, whimsical, magical, and deals with emotional themes that I found both cathartic and uplifting. The narrative touches on shame, burnout, personal growth, satisfaction, and introspection. There are low stakes here, no stressors, no time limits, and there are no fail states. The game actively encourages players to enjoy the moment, to take a breath, to reflect inward and delight in simple pleasures.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the same time, it has a strong and compulsive loop. Players grow plants, harvest fruits, acquire trinkets, make friends, and brew increasingly in-depth tea recipes (and other types of brews) with off-the-wall ingredients for an ever more diverse and colorful cast of characters, all who have powerful stories to share and lessons to bestow.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI loved this game and will absolutely be playing through again in the future. This is a fantastic example of games as an artform for me, and I feel fortunate that we get to experience creations like this.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\r\n\u003Cdiv id=\"msp1745834132138\" class=\"\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cdiv class=\"ms-product-badge mspb-large\" data-product-id=\"9p2195r38k3j\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-primary-image\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Ca href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9p2195r38k3j\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30523.14496762036507033.f433d16d-7b90-41d6-80cf-4b13d40ba8b8.e5b2f1ee-771b-4512-b778-7796f6d3354c?w=400&#038;h=600\" alt=\"Wanderstop\" class=\"skip-lazy\" /\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003C/a\u003E\r\n\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-details\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Ch2\u003EWanderstop\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-secondary-details\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-left-container\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cp\u003EAnnapurna Interactive\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-rating\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Cdiv\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cspan\u003E☆\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E☆\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E☆\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E☆\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E☆\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"mspb-total-ratings\"\u003E15\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-full-stars\" style=\"width: 75px\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cspan\u003E★\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E★\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E★\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E★\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E★\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-price\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan\u003E$24.99\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-buttons\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Ca class=\"mspb-link\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9p2195r38k3j\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EGet it now\u003C/a\u003E\r\n\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-right-container\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-description\"\u003E\r\n\t\tWanderstop is a narrative-centric cozy game about change and tea. Playing as a fallen fighter named Alta, you’ll manage a tea shop within a magical forest and tend to the customers who pass through. But Alta does not want to be here. And if she gets her way, the tea shop will be nothing but a brief and painful memory.\n\n\nWanderstop is a tea shop management ritual. Grow and harvest the ingredients needed for tea, and then mix them together in an unusual tea-making contraption. Along the way, speak with the many travelers who pass through the shop, learn their stories and make tea that’s just right for them.\n\nIn your downtime, you might tidy up around the clearing, decorate the shop in your style, or just sit on a bench with a cup of tea and listen to your own thoughts. Maybe doing nothing at all is okay. The shop demands patience, it rejects those who have come only in the pursuit of growth unchecked.\n\nAnd that’s why Alta can’t be here. It’s why she’ll never make it. This isn’t who she is. No, she’s a fighter! Why would anyone insist on turning the world’s greatest championship warrior into a docile shopkeeper?! With everything she’s capable of?? No no no, she won’t, she won’t do it&#8230; she can’t…\n\nWanderstop is a game from the team at Ivy Road, including Davey Wreden (creator of The Stanley Parable and The Beginner’s Guide), Karla Zimonja (co-creator of Gone Home and Tacoma) and Daniel “C418” Rosenfeld (the music of Minecraft).\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\n\n\n\u003Ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/promise-mascot-agency/9p6gcj303k9b\"\u003EPromise Mascot Agency\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Promise-Mascot-e94e0cce6ca5fd9a2d5f.jpg\" alt=\"Promise Mascot Agency Key Art\" class=\"wp-image-208734\" srcset=\"https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Promise-Mascot-e94e0cce6ca5fd9a2d5f.jpg 1920w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Promise-Mascot-e94e0cce6ca5fd9a2d5f-768x432.jpg 768w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Promise-Mascot-e94e0cce6ca5fd9a2d5f-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Promise-Mascot-e94e0cce6ca5fd9a2d5f-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat genre is this? Unhinged? I mean let’s be fair: What do you call a mascot management/relationship management sim/open world driver/Yakuza mystery narrative, with the most bizarre cast of characters you will ever come across? Fantastic, you call it fantastic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EPromise Mascot Agency\u003C/em\u003E is unlike anything I’ve played. The plot may seem bizarre, but the narrative is surprisingly wholesome. You&#8217;re a former Yakuza “fixer” sent out to a small town to run a local brand ambassador business. Accompanied by your mascot companion (who is… a living severed finger) and beat-up truck, you drive across town in effort to earn profit, all while uncovering a range of political conspiracies undermining it. This game is about a lot of things, but it really centers around optimism and adapting to new circumstances when things go awry. Very, very awry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOh my goodness, do I love this game. I literally could not stop playing. At its core, the game has you finding and recruiting a variety of mascots. You negotiate their benefits package, find clients that would employ them for events and send them out on jobs hoping that they won’t mess up, and inevitably get attacked by a demon, or some other hilariously random incidents that trigger a card-based minigame. On the one hand, the game is a very chill experience driven by a lot of narrative quests and casual management sim tracking and efficiency gameplay. On the other hand it’s an exploration driving game with few limits and plenty of ways to profit. The difficulty ramp on either side is gradual and not overwhelming. Overall, the gameplay loop was absolutely built for my short attention span and general weirdness, and the writing had me fall out of my chair laughing. On top of the that, the cast of mascots you meet are incredibly likeable in their own little, weird way.

Step into the chaos, unravel the conspiracies, drive a tiny truck and try to keep it all together in Promise Mascot Agency!\n\nWelcome to the Mascot Hustle \n\nYou thought mascots were just fluffy, innocent brand ambassadors? Think again. The Mascots are all living, breathing, fully formed personalities, with dreams, fears, and the occasional breakdowns of their own- just like us! Whether it’s Trororo, a charming cat who’s a little too obsessed with &quot;adult video&quot; or sweet, silken To-Fu, who can’t stop sobbing, your job is to befriend, mentor, and (hopefully) get these mascots to finish their jobs without causing a major catastrophe.\n\nPlay Your Cards Right\n\nSending your mascots out to work is never as easy as it sounds. One minute they’re promoting delicious food, the next they’re stuck in a doorway or starting a kitchen inferno. Need help? Good thing Kaso-Machi is full of intrepid everyday heroes ready to lend a hand (if you’ve managed to befriend them, of course). Unlock Hero Cards, featuring Kaso-Machi’s lovable local weirdos like Captain Sign, Japan’s only road-sign superhero (don’t ask questions), or Mama-San, a bar owner with a serious latex collection. These heroes will step in to provide help when your mascots inevitably lose control.\n\nTear Through Town in Your Upgradable Kei Truck\n\nKaso-Machi is a town full of secrets, and Michi isn’t just stuck in an office managing mascots &#8211; he’s on the road in his rusty (but upgradeable!) Kei Truck. This nifty little ride may look like a heap of junk, but with a few tweaks, it’ll have nitro boosts, glider wings, and even the ability to launch Pinky☆ &#8211; Michi’s maniacal mascot assistant &#8211; like a missile. Use your truck to explore the strange, forgotten town, unlock collectibles, and uncover hidden mysteries. Who knew a Kei Truck could be your best friend in a town where literally everything else hates you?!\n\nCrime! Drama! A Walking Finger?!  \n\nExiled after an ambush that left his clan in shambles, Michi finds himself piecing together the mystery of what really happened, while the town seems to actively conspire against him. Nightmare spirits seem a little too interested in your business, and there’s an ever-present sense that something’s very, very wrong in this place…\n\nThink you can resist? Think again. The mascots know where you live. Step into the world of Promise Mascot Agency and claim your place in this brave new world of mascot domination.\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\n\n\n\u003Ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/monaco-2/9p692dqm7n3j\"\u003EMonaco 2\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Monaco-2-eac45bfb39db9e2c582e.jpg\" alt=\"Monaco 2 Key Art\" class=\"wp-image-208735\" srcset=\"https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Monaco-2-eac45bfb39db9e2c582e.jpg 1920w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Monaco-2-eac45bfb39db9e2c582e-768x432.jpg 768w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Monaco-2-eac45bfb39db9e2c582e-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Monaco-2-eac45bfb39db9e2c582e-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMonaco 2\u003C/em\u003E, the sequel to a beloved, Xbox Live Arcade classic, is a top-down stealth-action game where you and up to three others cooperate as a band of thieves tasked with pulling off “perfect” heists. The flow of the game is relatively simple – players select a mission, go through a quick, narrative driven debriefing, select one of four unique characters, strategize through an interactable overview of the level&#8217;s layout through Blueprint Mode, and proceed to the mission. Where it gets complicated is when you actually enter the premises. You can create the most elaborate plan ever, but it can (and almost always will) fall apart once someone is detected by a guard or walks through a laser, triggering an alarm.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI spent most of my time in the single player mode, which was fine since the game offers the ability to switch between characters at various checkpoints. I was able to squeeze by the first few missions as one character, but you’ll quickly realize the strategic advantages of leveraging the whole cast as missions become progressively more elaborate. My favorite character is Sake since I not only loved her design, but her emphasis on speed and stealth. She’s perfect for beginners as, when situations get too sticky, you can count on her dodge roll to avoid attacks. Of course, there’s also Una who doesn’t really care about the game’s rules – opting for combat over stealth with her ability to knock guards out. \u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI found the most fun weaving in and out of strategic stealth to cat and mouse chases. Getting caught and leveraging shadows, barriers and furniture to juke and loop the guards, only to return undetected, felt extremely satisfying every time. While I did have fun solo, I recommend firing this up with friends whether online or locally!\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\r\n\u003Cdiv id=\"msp1745834132138\" class=\"\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cdiv class=\"ms-product-badge mspb-large\" data-product-id=\"9p692dqm7n3j\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-primary-image\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Ca href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9p692dqm7n3j\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21366.14624034405803797.d71614cd-3190-4d47-a15b-a58d3d098823.cfe7dd3a-e5f0-47f2-8b96-2005e2c26d95?w=400&#038;h=600\" alt=\"Monaco 2\" class=\"skip-lazy\" /\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003C/a\u003E\r\n\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-details\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Ch2\u003EMonaco 2\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-secondary-details\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-left-container\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cp\u003EHumble Games\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-rating\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Cdiv\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cspan\u003E☆\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E☆\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E☆\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E☆\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E☆\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"mspb-total-ratings\"\u003E6\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-full-stars\" style=\"width: 75px\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cspan\u003E★\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E★\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E★\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E★\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E★\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-price\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan\u003E$24.99\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-buttons\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Ca class=\"mspb-link\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9p692dqm7n3j\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EGet it now\u003C/a\u003E\r\n\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-right-container\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-description\"\u003E\r\n\t\tMonaco is a city overflowing with luxury and greed, which makes it a perfect target for you and your international gang of criminal masterminds.

Freeriding in backcountries means a lot of snow to plow and riding in it is way different than on other terrains. You must master the steering by shifting your weight around, making turns with your throttle, counter steering with your skis, and many other new skills. Once you master the skills needed in the backcountries, you&#039;re unstoppable and no pow will make you stuck.\n\n&#8211; Freeride snowmobile simulator with real-world physics in deep-snow backcountry\n&#8211; Ride with and against your friends in epic freeriding experience\n&#8211; Online, crossplatform multiplayer takes you ride around the world with a likeminded community of sledheads\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\n\n\n\u003Ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/sticky-business/9nh4jxdl32p0\"\u003ESticky Business\u003C/a\u003E\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Sticky-Business-5a36643433a7ac2f2a64.jpg\" alt=\"Sticky Business Key Art\" class=\"wp-image-208737\" srcset=\"https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Sticky-Business-5a36643433a7ac2f2a64.jpg 1920w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Sticky-Business-5a36643433a7ac2f2a64-768x432.jpg 768w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Sticky-Business-5a36643433a7ac2f2a64-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Sticky-Business-5a36643433a7ac2f2a64-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EI used to love stickers as a kid, but I never thought about designing and showing off my own creations. Enter \u003Cem\u003ESticky Business\u003C/em\u003E, a cozy, small business simulator game where your motivation is to run a small business designing, selling, and packing stickers for a variety of customers. No end of the world scenarios, no final boss to violently fight off, and no heart stopping action. The game is as advertised: cozy as it comes and twice as wholesome.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter naming your store, you start at your desk and begin designing stickers for customers. You have hundreds of parts and options to choose from, and they can be meticulously layered to make some truly ridiculous stuff. Illustration sizes, text colors, outline sizes, and other options can tweaked and changed rather easily. You don’t have the option to use individual letters to make your own words (which makes sense, even though I really just want to make a wholesome Wu-Tang sticker). Still, there’s some pre-made words that you can put together, so I’m a bit proud of my line of “Cozy Metal” stickers with various combinations of animals and instruments. Yes, it’s dumb, but I do enjoy them very much.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EOnce your design is finished, you can pay coins to print them on different types of sheets. You have to be extremely thoughtful about how you to fit the stickers to the sheet because a single sheet costs the same regardless of how many stickers you can fit on it. More stickers, more profit. You then package everything up exactly how you want it and send it off to make some cold hard cash (and hearts) which you can use for upgrading and unlocking more designs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EUnlike most games, the story doesn’t revolve around you. Instead, it’s entirely focused on your customers, who write you about their lives and how stickers fit into their narratives. Some are heartwarming, some are ridiculous. You’ll find that different stickers attract different customers and there will be some requests for specific types of stickers that you’ll need to fulfill. It’s a great, short Etsy-sim that’s super soothing and chill. Especially if you have younger kids, nieces, or nephews that are into design, this a great find.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\r\n\u003Cdiv id=\"msp1745834132138\" class=\"\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cdiv class=\"ms-product-badge mspb-large\" data-product-id=\"9nh4jxdl32p0\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-primary-image\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Ca href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9nh4jxdl32p0\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14636.13637054054823905.9bf27574-1e3d-4d96-878d-9dde61b08bdd.6b60410b-a00a-4b70-90e4-90079fd438e4?w=400&#038;h=600\" alt=\"Sticky Business\" class=\"skip-lazy\" /\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003C/a\u003E\r\n\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-details\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Ch2\u003ESticky Business\u003C/h2\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-secondary-details\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-left-container\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cp\u003EAssemble Entertainment\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-rating\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Cdiv\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cspan\u003E☆\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E☆\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E☆\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E☆\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E☆\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan class=\"mspb-total-ratings\"\u003E3\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-full-stars\" style=\"width: 75px\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003Cspan\u003E★\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E★\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E★\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E★\u003C/span\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E★\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-price\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cspan\u003E$9.99\u003C/span\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\r\n\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-buttons\"\u003E\r\n\t\u003Ca class=\"mspb-link\" href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/9nh4jxdl32p0\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EGet it now\u003C/a\u003E\r\n\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\u003C/div\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-right-container\"\u003E\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cdiv class=\"mspb-description\"\u003E\r\n\t\tCreate, pack and sell your own unique sticker creations!\n\nExperience the joy of running your own cozy small business: Create stickers, pack orders and hear your customers’ stories.

You want something familiar and comforting, but also something just a little different. You want to mix it up with some excitement, but still maintain a sense of connection to what you already know and love. Something balanced. Well, aren’t you in luck! This month the ID@Xbox team has handpicked six Indie Selects that have immaculate vibes.\n\n\n\n\nWe give you a bit of intensity with a co-op heist and gliding down mountains; chill out with heartfelt narratives over some tea and a bit of sticker commerce; and, finally, run some very strange errands while strategically expanding your universe. Perfection! Here’s what we’ve got for you this month (in no particular order):\nWanderstop\n\n\n\n\nFrom the creator of The Stanley Parable and The Beginner’s Guide, Wanderstop is a narrative-centric cozy game about change and… tea. Playing as a fallen fighter named Alta, you’ll manage a tea shop within a magical forest and tend to the customers who pass through. But Alta does not want to be here. And if she gets her way, the tea shop will be nothing but a brief and painful memory.\nWhile this year’s Game Developers Conference was incredibly energizing and inspiring, it was also stressful and overwhelming at times. I needed a meditative escape after I got home, and Wanderstop was the perfect game to help me recharge. It’s beautiful, whimsical, magical, and deals with emotional themes that I found both cathartic and uplifting. The narrative touches on shame, burnout, personal growth, satisfaction, and introspection. There are low stakes here, no stressors, no time limits, and there are no fail states. The game actively encourages players to enjoy the moment, to take a breath, to reflect inward and delight in simple pleasures.\nAt the same time, it has a strong and compulsive loop. Players grow plants, harvest fruits, acquire trinkets, make friends, and brew increasingly in-depth tea recipes (and other types of brews) with off-the-wall ingredients for an ever more diverse and colorful cast of characters, all who have powerful stories to share and lessons to bestow.\nI loved this game and will absolutely be playing through again in the future. This is a fantastic example of games as an artform for me, and I feel fortunate that we get to experience creations like this.\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\nWanderstop\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAnnapurna Interactive\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t☆☆☆☆☆\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t15\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t★★★★★\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t$24.99\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tGet it now\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\tWanderstop is a narrative-centric cozy game about change and tea. Playing as a fallen fighter named Alta, you’ll manage a tea shop within a magical forest and tend to the customers who pass through. But Alta does not want to be here. And if she gets her way, the tea shop will be nothing but a brief and painful memory.\n\n\nWanderstop is a tea shop management ritual. Grow and harvest the ingredients needed for tea, and then mix them together in an unusual tea-making contraption. Along the way, speak with the many travelers who pass through the shop, learn their stories and make tea that’s just right for them.\n\nIn your downtime, you might tidy up around the clearing, decorate the shop in your style, or just sit on a bench with a cup of tea and listen to your own thoughts. Maybe doing nothing at all is okay. The shop demands patience, it rejects those who have come only in the pursuit of growth unchecked.\n\nAnd that’s why Alta can’t be here. It’s why she’ll never make it. This isn’t who she is. No, she’s a fighter! Why would anyone insist on turning the world’s greatest championship warrior into a docile shopkeeper?! With everything she’s capable of?? No no no, she won’t, she won’t do it… she can’t…\n\nWanderstop is a game from the team at Ivy Road, including Davey Wreden (creator of The Stanley Parable and The Beginner’s Guide), Karla Zimonja (co-creator of Gone Home and Tacoma) and Daniel “C418” Rosenfeld (the music of Minecraft).\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\nPromise Mascot Agency\n\n\n\n\nWhat genre is this? Unhinged? I mean let’s be fair: What do you call a mascot management/relationship management sim/open world driver/Yakuza mystery narrative, with the most bizarre cast of characters you will ever come across? Fantastic, you call it fantastic.\nPromise Mascot Agency is unlike anything I’ve played. The plot may seem bizarre, but the narrative is surprisingly wholesome. You’re a former Yakuza “fixer” sent out to a small town to run a local brand ambassador business. Accompanied by your mascot companion (who is… a living severed finger) and beat-up truck, you drive across town in effort to earn profit, all while uncovering a range of political conspiracies undermining it. This game is about a lot of things, but it really centers around optimism and adapting to new circumstances when things go awry. Very, very awry.\nOh my goodness, do I love this game. I literally could not stop playing. At its core, the game has you finding and recruiting a variety of mascots. You negotiate their benefits package, find clients that would employ them for events and send them out on jobs hoping that they won’t mess up, and inevitably get attacked by a demon, or some other hilariously random incidents that trigger a card-based minigame. On the one hand, the game is a very chill experience driven by a lot of narrative quests and casual management sim tracking and efficiency gameplay. On the other hand it’s an exploration driving game with few limits and plenty of ways to profit. The difficulty ramp on either side is gradual and not overwhelming. Overall, the gameplay loop was absolutely built for my short attention span and general weirdness, and the writing had me fall out of my chair laughing. On top of the that, the cast of mascots you meet are incredibly likeable in their own little, weird way. You’re bound to find a favorite.\nAs chaotic as this all may seem, this experience was incredibly cozy and heartwarming. The gameplay is, indeed, fairly simple, but it’s so unique in its presentation that it kept me glued. I think people who enjoy the Yakuza series would especially enjoy this, but honestly I’d want everyone to play this totally preposterous game about you and your giant finger friend helping a town become whole again. \n\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\nPromise Mascot Agency\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nKaizen Game Works Limited\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t☆☆☆☆☆\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t26\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t★★★★★\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t$24.99\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tGet it now\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\tFrom the creators of Paradise Killer comes a mind-bending open-world narrative adventure mascot management simulator where mascots are more than just symbols – they’re unpredictable forces of nature! Step into the chaos, unravel the conspiracies, drive a tiny truck and try to keep it all together in Promise Mascot Agency!\n\nWelcome to the Mascot Hustle \n\nYou thought mascots were just fluffy, innocent brand ambassadors? Think again. The Mascots are all living, breathing, fully formed personalities, with dreams, fears, and the occasional breakdowns of their own- just like us! Whether it’s Trororo, a charming cat who’s a little too obsessed with \"adult video\" or sweet, silken To-Fu, who can’t stop sobbing, your job is to befriend, mentor, and (hopefully) get these mascots to finish their jobs without causing a major catastrophe.\n\nPlay Your Cards Right\n\nSending your mascots out to work is never as easy as it sounds. One minute they’re promoting delicious food, the next they’re stuck in a doorway or starting a kitchen inferno. Need help? Good thing Kaso-Machi is full of intrepid everyday heroes ready to lend a hand (if you’ve managed to befriend them, of course). Unlock Hero Cards, featuring Kaso-Machi’s lovable local weirdos like Captain Sign, Japan’s only road-sign superhero (don’t ask questions), or Mama-San, a bar owner with a serious latex collection. These heroes will step in to provide help when your mascots inevitably lose control.\n\nTear Through Town in Your Upgradable Kei Truck\n\nKaso-Machi is a town full of secrets, and Michi isn’t just stuck in an office managing mascots – he’s on the road in his rusty (but upgradeable!) Kei Truck. This nifty little ride may look like a heap of junk, but with a few tweaks, it’ll have nitro boosts, glider wings, and even the ability to launch Pinky☆ – Michi’s maniacal mascot assistant – like a missile. Use your truck to explore the strange, forgotten town, unlock collectibles, and uncover hidden mysteries. Who knew a Kei Truck could be your best friend in a town where literally everything else hates you?!\n\nCrime! Drama! A Walking Finger?!  \n\nExiled after an ambush that left his clan in shambles, Michi finds himself piecing together the mystery of what really happened, while the town seems to actively conspire against him. Nightmare spirits seem a little too interested in your business, and there’s an ever-present sense that something’s very, very wrong in this place…\n\nThink you can resist? Think again. The mascots know where you live. Step into the world of Promise Mascot Agency and claim your place in this brave new world of mascot domination.\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\nMonaco 2\n\n\n\n\nMonaco 2, the sequel to a beloved, Xbox Live Arcade classic, is a top-down stealth-action game where you and up to three others cooperate as a band of thieves tasked with pulling off “perfect” heists. The flow of the game is relatively simple – players select a mission, go through a quick, narrative driven debriefing, select one of four unique characters, strategize through an interactable overview of the level’s layout through Blueprint Mode, and proceed to the mission. Where it gets complicated is when you actually enter the premises. You can create the most elaborate plan ever, but it can (and almost always will) fall apart once someone is detected by a guard or walks through a laser, triggering an alarm.\nI spent most of my time in the single player mode, which was fine since the game offers the ability to switch between characters at various checkpoints. I was able to squeeze by the first few missions as one character, but you’ll quickly realize the strategic advantages of leveraging the whole cast as missions become progressively more elaborate. My favorite character is Sake since I not only loved her design, but her emphasis on speed and stealth. She’s perfect for beginners as, when situations get too sticky, you can count on her dodge roll to avoid attacks. Of course, there’s also Una who doesn’t really care about the game’s rules – opting for combat over stealth with her ability to knock guards out. \nI found the most fun weaving in and out of strategic stealth to cat and mouse chases. Getting caught and leveraging shadows, barriers and furniture to juke and loop the guards, only to return undetected, felt extremely satisfying every time. While I did have fun solo, I recommend firing this up with friends whether online or locally!\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\nMonaco 2\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHumble Games\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t☆☆☆☆☆\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t6\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t★★★★★\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t$24.99\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tGet it now\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\tMonaco is a city overflowing with luxury and greed, which makes it a perfect target for you and your international gang of criminal masterminds.

With Blueprint Mode, you can look at the level’s layout before you start the mission, allowing you to case the joint before you and your friends fleece it for all its worth.\n\n\nThey say there’s no honor among thieves, but they’ve never met your crew! Team up with up to three other players in local or online multiplayer and plan your heist. However, nothing ever goes exactly according to plan in Monaco, so you’ll need to work together and improvise if you want to get away with your haul of riches.\n\n\nMonaco 2 offers a new level of immersion with an updated 3D art style and a procedurally generated level design system. Complete the structured campaign or test your skills against the hundreds of seeded levels, proving once and for all that you and your friends are the ultimate thieves!\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\nSledders\n\n\n\n\nSledders is an open-world snowmobiling simulator that captures the true spirit of backcountry freedom and exploration. Unlike other entries in the genre, it offers less arcade-style gameplay and instead focuses on realism. It features physics-based snow environments and a robust catalog of fully licensed snowmobiles – including some awesome retro models. If you ever daydreamed about carving through untouched powder, discovering new trails, racing for bragging rights, or trying out new tricks, Sledders might just be your next favorite ride.\nWhat stood out the most to me is how the sleds handle. They don’t just glide over the snow, they dig in, sink under the weight, and fight back like they should. You have to shift your weight, ease into the throttle, and use your skills to navigate the terrain. It’s challenging at first, so be prepared to fall often. But don’t worry, sticking to the trails is a great way to familiarize yourself with your sled before heading off into the wild. Once you find your rhythm, it’s addictive.\nWhether you’re a weekend warrior looking for a peaceful solo ride, hosting a private session with friends, or a hardcore sledhead ready to challenge the world, Sledders meets you where you are with multiplatform cross-play support for up to 32 players. You can customize every detail of your sleds in the garage, and it offers plenty of options to style your character with gear that matches your look. If you’re looking for a game that lets you ride on your own terms and at your own pace, Sledders delivers an experience that will stay with you long after the snow melts.\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\nSledders\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nBonus Stage Oy\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t☆☆☆☆☆\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t207\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t★★★★★\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t$34.99\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tGet it now\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\tShred your sled in open-world backcountries. Sledders is a realistic, physics-based snowmobile simulator. Manoeuvre the big open terrain, plow through tons of fresh snow, conquer the mountains, and reach the peak faster than your friends!\n\nSit back, relax, and enjoy as you rip around on one of the sleds speeding between trees and throwing it around at the ridges. The limits are only set by you so let loose and show us what you can accomplish!\n\nThe game offers a big map for you to explore and play around in. It contains steep hills, mountains, lots of trees, and open areas ready to be ridden by you (yeah, there's a plenty of jumps, and also water…)! It will take ages for you to ride from one corner to another, that's how big the map already is. And who knows what the future holds, our plans include bigger, better, and many more maps to come (we hear you ditch bangers, snow crossers, tricksters, trail riders, and all!).\n\nThe snow in Sledders feel as real as possible, so you better sharpen up your powder skills or you'll just keep on digging deeper and deeper into the snow! Freeriding in backcountries means a lot of snow to plow and riding in it is way different than on other terrains. You must master the steering by shifting your weight around, making turns with your throttle, counter steering with your skis, and many other new skills. Once you master the skills needed in the backcountries, you're unstoppable and no pow will make you stuck.\n\n– Freeride snowmobile simulator with real-world physics in deep-snow backcountry\n– Ride with and against your friends in epic freeriding experience\n– Online, crossplatform multiplayer takes you ride around the world with a likeminded community of sledheads\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\r\n\n\n\nSticky Business\n\n\n\n\nI used to love stickers as a kid, but I never thought about designing and showing off my own creations. Enter Sticky Business, a cozy, small business simulator game where your motivation is to run a small business designing, selling, and packing stickers for a variety of customers. No end of the world scenarios, no final boss to violently fight off, and no heart stopping action. The game is as advertised: cozy as it comes and twice as wholesome.\nAfter naming your store, you start at your desk and begin designing stickers for customers. You have hundreds of parts and options to choose from, and they can be meticulously layered to make some truly ridiculous stuff. Illustration sizes, text colors, outline sizes, and other options can tweaked and changed rather easily. You don’t have the option to use individual letters to make your own words (which makes sense, even though I really just want to make a wholesome Wu-Tang sticker). Still, there’s some pre-made words that you can put together, so I’m a bit proud of my line of “Cozy Metal” stickers with various combinations of animals and instruments. Yes, it’s dumb, but I do enjoy them very much.\nOnce your design is finished, you can pay coins to print them on different types of sheets. You have to be extremely thoughtful about how you to fit the stickers to the sheet because a single sheet costs the same regardless of how many stickers you can fit on it. More stickers, more profit. You then package everything up exactly how you want it and send it off to make some cold hard cash (and hearts) which you can use for upgrading and unlocking more designs.\nUnlike most games, the story doesn’t revolve around you. Instead, it’s entirely focused on your customers, who write you about their lives and how stickers fit into their narratives. Some are heartwarming, some are ridiculous. You’ll find that different stickers attract different customers and there will be some requests for specific types of stickers that you’ll need to fulfill. It’s a great, short Etsy-sim that’s super soothing and chill. Especially if you have younger kids, nieces, or nephews that are into design, this a great find.\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\nSticky Business\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAssemble Entertainment\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t☆☆☆☆☆\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t3\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t★★★★★\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t$9.99\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tGet it now\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\tCreate, pack and sell your own unique sticker creations!\n\nExperience the joy of running your own cozy small business: Create stickers, pack orders and hear your customers’ stories.

While each class has a “theme” defined by the weapon type, there’s versatility in how you can play with them. Even if you think you’ll prefer a certain loadout, it’s worth giving them all a go, and with Towerborne’s frictionless class-swapping and re-spec options, changing your mind (and your build) is an absolute breeze.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Towerborne_TT9-440d4dacd890ea540078.jpg\" alt=\"Towerborne Screenshot\" class=\"wp-image-208459\" srcset=\"https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Towerborne_TT9-440d4dacd890ea540078.jpg 1920w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Towerborne_TT9-440d4dacd890ea540078-768x432.jpg 768w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Towerborne_TT9-440d4dacd890ea540078-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Towerborne_TT9-440d4dacd890ea540078-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBuild for Success\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EThe new Class Mastery Update (\u003Ca href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/24/towerbornes-class-mastery-update/\"\u003Ewhich we covered in-depth last week\u003C/a\u003E) gives even more versatility to each class in \u003Cem\u003ETowerborne\u003C/em\u003E. There’s now countless more ways to play with each weapon, with the addition of new skill trees that let you hone a specific playstyle. Sentinel can be a fast and offensive frontline attacker, but it can also be sturdy and defensive. Some builds can focus heavily on dealing raw damage, while others can lean more towards a support build, lifting your teammates. Here’s a few examples across each of the available classes:\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBleed Build:\u003C/strong\u003E The Sentinel class comes with several skills that deal or enhance bleed, which deals slow damage to enemies you’ve hit over time. The ‘Bloodlust’ skill lets you deal 10% more damage against bleeding enemies, and the ‘Sanguine Burst’ skill enables your heavy combo to consume all bleed stacks, triggering an explosion that deals massive damage.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESear Build:\u003C/strong\u003E The Pyroclast is all about inflicting burndamage, but there’s a few ways to build upon that. The skill ‘Persistent Pyre’ will increase the duration of your Sear damage, and when your Sear skill is active, you’ll be able to pull off moves like ‘Ember Cyclone’, a stylish airborne attack, and ‘Ember Spike’, which delivers a long-range tremor that explodes on the closest enemy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EPowderkeg Build: \u003C/strong\u003EThe Rockbreaker already packs a punch, but you can amplify its impact even more now. Stacking “Quick Charge” skills to make your Powderkeg Punch charge faster, which is always great. The skill “Cracking Skulls” gives you a fully charged Powderkeg Punch if you break an enemy’s Break Bar. Couple that with “Cracking Knuckles” and you’re able to gain a full charge by Block Breaking an enemy. You can even do the weapon mechanic in the air now or transform it into a lunging attack with the “Bare Knuckles Blast” skill. If you’re a fan of big punches, then this is a great way to build your Rockbreaker. &nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EProjectile Frenzy Build:\u003C/strong\u003E This is a super fun Shadowstriker that revolves around the power of projectiles. The “Shooting Stars” skill unlocks a handful of kunai, and the “Shadow Feint Ammo” skills increase your ammo count so that you can use your Weapon Mechanic more often, allowing you to launch projectiles all over the place. The “Shadowsting” Skill is what really sets this build apart though &#8211; this modifies your Weapon Mechanic in a way where you no longer teleport, but it costs half the weapon meter to use and deals poison. If you’re the type of player who likes to alternate between mid to long range combat, this is the skill set for you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ESupport Build: \u003C/strong\u003EHealers are the underrated heroes of any party, but in \u003Cem\u003ETowerborne\u003C/em\u003E, any of the four available classes can spec out into a support character. There are skills that can upgrade how much health your healing flasks give back, increase how many you carry, and even an ability that lets other players benefit from your healing if they’re nearby. Anyone can pick up these skills providing they’re a high enough level, and the ability to swap and change skills at the click of a button means no one is indefinitely locked into that support role (unless you want to be, of course!).\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Towerborne_ScreenShot03-caf0d66036a66c7f7bc7.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-208771\" srcset=\"https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Towerborne_ScreenShot03-caf0d66036a66c7f7bc7.jpg 1920w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Towerborne_ScreenShot03-caf0d66036a66c7f7bc7-768x432.jpg 768w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Towerborne_ScreenShot03-caf0d66036a66c7f7bc7-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Towerborne_ScreenShot03-caf0d66036a66c7f7bc7-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETake Your Time, Memorize The Moves\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EGobos are not stealthy or subtle creatures, but some of the nastier ones do pack quite a punch. In more difficult fights, there’s no shame in holding back for just a moment to work out how your enemy is going to attack, and what you can do to combat it. Lots of Gobo moves come with signals that indicate what they’re about to do, whether it’s a long-range projectile, a swift claw hit or a sluggish tail thwack. Keeping an eye on the battlefield and recognising their patterns means you’ll be able to dodge and weave, find windows to attack, and most importantly, avoid taking damage so you can save your Mender’s (healing) Flasks for more unpredictable battles later in the mission.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETaste of Their Own Medicine\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003EIt’s not just your weapons that can deal damage to gobos and goons – you can take advantage of their gear too. As an example, some gobos carry bombs to throw at you, and a swift enough hit will knock them off course, causing them to drop the projectile at their own feet. The gobos also won’t move to avoid the damage, instead opting to cover their eyes and pray, so it’s a great way to finish a few off, or buy some time while you’re cleaning up the field. Some levels will also include environmental hazards, like thorns or exploding barrels. Baiting a gobo into hitting a barrel will not end well for them, and that’s another way to deal big damage if your weapon is preoccupied with other targets. It’s also just extremely satisfying, every single time.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cfigure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"\u003E\u003Cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Towerborne_ScreenShot13-2260aaefa2ecaa562262.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-208772\" srcset=\"https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Towerborne_ScreenShot13-2260aaefa2ecaa562262.jpg 1920w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Towerborne_ScreenShot13-2260aaefa2ecaa562262-768x432.jpg 768w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Towerborne_ScreenShot13-2260aaefa2ecaa562262-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://xboxwire.thesourcemediaassets.com/sites/2/2025/04/Towerborne_ScreenShot13-2260aaefa2ecaa562262-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /\u003E\u003C/figure\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Ch2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EUmbra Abilities\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\n\n\n\n\u003Cp\u003ENot only are Umbra cute little companions, they also come loaded with different powerful abilities that’ll assist your Ace in battle. Your first Umbra, Iska, offers a long-range projectile to complement the close-range combat that most classes start with. As you progress, you’ll uncover opportunities to earn new Umbra.

          "content:encodedSnippet": "Category: Games\nApril 29, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTowerborne Arrives on Xbox Today – Five Tips to Help You “Ace” Your Adventure\n\nDanielle Partis\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nIt’s finally time –Towerborne arrives on Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC, Xbox Cloud and with Game Pass today! To celebrate the looter-brawler’s entrance into Xbox Game Preview, we’ve compiled some tips and tricks to get you started on your Ace adventure.\nExperiment!\nWhile Towerborne is easy for anyone to pick up and play, there is a satisfying depth to its combat systems – and combinations of skills and attacks you’ll only uncover by experimenting with each of the four classes. While each class has a “theme” defined by the weapon type, there’s versatility in how you can play with them. Even if you think you’ll prefer a certain loadout, it’s worth giving them all a go, and with Towerborne’s frictionless class-swapping and re-spec options, changing your mind (and your build) is an absolute breeze.\n\n\n\n\nBuild for Success\nThe new Class Mastery Update (which we covered in-depth last week) gives even more versatility to each class in Towerborne. There’s now countless more ways to play with each weapon, with the addition of new skill trees that let you hone a specific playstyle. Sentinel can be a fast and offensive frontline attacker, but it can also be sturdy and defensive. Some builds can focus heavily on dealing raw damage, while others can lean more towards a support build, lifting your teammates. Here’s a few examples across each of the available classes:\nBleed Build: The Sentinel class comes with several skills that deal or enhance bleed, which deals slow damage to enemies you’ve hit over time. The ‘Bloodlust’ skill lets you deal 10% more damage against bleeding enemies, and the ‘Sanguine Burst’ skill enables your heavy combo to consume all bleed stacks, triggering an explosion that deals massive damage.\nSear Build: The Pyroclast is all about inflicting burndamage, but there’s a few ways to build upon that. The skill ‘Persistent Pyre’ will increase the duration of your Sear damage, and when your Sear skill is active, you’ll be able to pull off moves like ‘Ember Cyclone’, a stylish airborne attack, and ‘Ember Spike’, which delivers a long-range tremor that explodes on the closest enemy.\nPowderkeg Build: The Rockbreaker already packs a punch, but you can amplify its impact even more now. Stacking “Quick Charge” skills to make your Powderkeg Punch charge faster, which is always great. The skill “Cracking Skulls” gives you a fully charged Powderkeg Punch if you break an enemy’s Break Bar. Couple that with “Cracking Knuckles” and you’re able to gain a full charge by Block Breaking an enemy. You can even do the weapon mechanic in the air now or transform it into a lunging attack with the “Bare Knuckles Blast” skill. If you’re a fan of big punches, then this is a great way to build your Rockbreaker.  \nProjectile Frenzy Build: This is a super fun Shadowstriker that revolves around the power of projectiles. The “Shooting Stars” skill unlocks a handful of kunai, and the “Shadow Feint Ammo” skills increase your ammo count so that you can use your Weapon Mechanic more often, allowing you to launch projectiles all over the place. The “Shadowsting” Skill is what really sets this build apart though – this modifies your Weapon Mechanic in a way where you no longer teleport, but it costs half the weapon meter to use and deals poison. If you’re the type of player who likes to alternate between mid to long range combat, this is the skill set for you.\nSupport Build: Healers are the underrated heroes of any party, but in Towerborne, any of the four available classes can spec out into a support character. There are skills that can upgrade how much health your healing flasks give back, increase how many you carry, and even an ability that lets other players benefit from your healing if they’re nearby. Anyone can pick up these skills providing they’re a high enough level, and the ability to swap and change skills at the click of a button means no one is indefinitely locked into that support role (unless you want to be, of course!).\n\n\n\n\nTake Your Time, Memorize The Moves\nGobos are not stealthy or subtle creatures, but some of the nastier ones do pack quite a punch. In more difficult fights, there’s no shame in holding back for just a moment to work out how your enemy is going to attack, and what you can do to combat it. Lots of Gobo moves come with signals that indicate what they’re about to do, whether it’s a long-range projectile, a swift claw hit or a sluggish tail thwack. Keeping an eye on the battlefield and recognising their patterns means you’ll be able to dodge and weave, find windows to attack, and most importantly, avoid taking damage so you can save your Mender’s (healing) Flasks for more unpredictable battles later in the mission.\nTaste of Their Own Medicine\nIt’s not just your weapons that can deal damage to gobos and goons – you can take advantage of their gear too. As an example, some gobos carry bombs to throw at you, and a swift enough hit will knock them off course, causing them to drop the projectile at their own feet. The gobos also won’t move to avoid the damage, instead opting to cover their eyes and pray, so it’s a great way to finish a few off, or buy some time while you’re cleaning up the field. Some levels will also include environmental hazards, like thorns or exploding barrels. Baiting a gobo into hitting a barrel will not end well for them, and that’s another way to deal big damage if your weapon is preoccupied with other targets. It’s also just extremely satisfying, every single time.\n\n\n\n\nUmbra Abilities\nNot only are Umbra cute little companions, they also come loaded with different powerful abilities that’ll assist your Ace in battle. Your first Umbra, Iska, offers a long-range projectile to complement the close-range combat that most classes start with. As you progress, you’ll uncover opportunities to earn new Umbra. Pox, for example, unlocks new aerial combos, while Picus can ignite the environment around them in a ring of fire. Each one is super unique, and their abilities can either enhance your playstyle, or add a refreshing contrasting perk to your skillset.\n\n\n\n\nWe can’t wait to see you in the Belfry and hope these tips will aid you well on your first adventures throughout the world of Towerborne.

          "content:encodedSnippet": "Category: Games\nApril 29, 2025\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nA Note from Stoic – Towerborne Arrives on Xbox Today\n\nTrisha StoufferCEO & President, Stoic\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nTowerborne is released today in Xbox Game Preview on Xbox Series X|S, Windows PC, cloud, Game Pass, and as an Xbox Play Anywhere title. It’s a big moment for all of us at Stoic, and we wanted to take a moment to talk about our journey so far—and where Towerborne is going next.\nAt its core, Towerborne is a new kind of Looter Brawler—side-scrolling, pick-up-and-play combat fused with deep ARPG progression. You take on the role of an Ace, a spirit-forged hero sworn to defend the Belfry, humanity’s last refuge. Venture solo or squad up in online co-op (or couch co-op on Xbox!); every swing, every loot drop, and every Umbra companion you recruit pushes back the darkness beyond those tower walls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur release via Xbox Game Preview marks a watershed moment in Towerborne’s journey, a game we started building years ago. That early spark of imagination grew into the world you’re stepping into today. The release today also brings a sizable update that deepens progression through the new Class Mastery system, reshapes the world map with dozens of handcrafted missions, and introduces fresh Umbra, legendary gear, and a formidable new foe. You can read all the details on towerborne.com.\nSince releasing the first Early Access version of the game on Steam in September 2024, player feedback has shaped and improved mission flow, weapon feel, party-finder tools, and more. New Aces will join the ranks of our growing community and help decide where Towerborne heads next—across end-game challenges, community events, and future updates. Cross-play and shared progression across all platforms ensures that every discovery you make travels freely across all platforms.\nGame Preview is our next big step. As Towerborne evolves, we will unlock new regions, new game modes, new classes and biomes, new endgame challenges, and ideas we haven’t even thought of yet. The full, free-to-play, 1.0 launch of Towerborne is still to come. Every step on the path will be forged hand-in-hand with you.\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n1 of 4\n\n\n2 of 4\n\n\n3 of 4\n\n4 of 4\t\t\t\t\t\nStoic’s story started over a decade ago in a small room, with sketches on whiteboards and a dream that players would care about the kinds of stories we wanted to tell—ones drawn by hand and built with heart. Today, the team is bigger, the tower higher, but what holds it all up remains the same: imagination, perseverance, and the players who bring it to life.\nTo everyone who has played, cheered us on, sent feedback, or told a friend—you remind us why we do this. Why co-op matters. Why heroes rise together.\nSo pick up your favorite weapon, gather your Umbra, and meet us at the Belfry. We’ll be there, fighting by your side. \n\n\n\r\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\nTowerborne (Game Preview)\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nXbox Game Studios \n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t☆☆☆☆☆\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t194\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t★★★★★\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tGet it now\r\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\tPC Game Pass\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\tXbox Game Pass\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\tTowerborne is a new kind of Looter Brawler, combining side-scrolling combat with action RPG loot progression and endless customization.* You are an Ace, born anew from the spirit realm with special skills, grit, and determination. Unite with other Aces** and fight as one to defend the Belfry, humanity’s last refuge, from the dark forces outside its walls. Can you become the Ace humanity needs to survive? Explore, fight, and grow stronger – together \n\nExplore Together –  With an evolving world map and ongoing updates, your adventure continues with new enemies, regions, rewards, and story. Venture solo or with up to three other Aces** and recruit Umbra allies with unique abilities to join your fight. Return to the Belfry to reforge gear and continue your journey. \n \nFight Your Way – Jump into satisfying, pick-up-and-play brawler combat that's easy to learn but challenging to master. Towerborne delivers fast-paced, thrilling battles with deep, evolving strategy. Every fight is a chance to sharpen your skills and face tougher challenges.\n\nEndless Customization* – Customize your Ace's appearance, gear, and weapons. Set your preferred danger level in the Wilds, wield powerful weapons with special moves, and mix gear and Umbra companions to create a playstyle that's uniquely yours. \n\nThis game is a work in progress. Some content and features may change over time before full release of the game. Please purchase only if you are comfortable with the game in its current state.\n\nFull details on the latest status of the game, and how you can give feedback and report issues can be found at https://www.Towerborne.com/.\n\n* This game includes optional in-game purchases of virtual currency that can be used to acquire virtual in-game items.\n\n**Online console multiplayer requires Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or Game Pass Core (subscriptions sold separately).\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\t\n\r\n\t\t\n\r\n\t\n\r\n\r\n\n\t\t\n         \n            \n for “A Note from Stoic – Towerborne Arrives on Xbox Today”\n                    \n\nCategory: Games\n\nThe Past, Present, and Future of Overwatch 2’s Stadium\n                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                                \nCategory: ID@Xbox\n\nEverafter Falls 2.0 – A Year in Listening and Twisting\n                                            \n                                                                                    \n                                                \nCategory: Games\n\nFree Play Days – Forza Motorsport and The Escapists\n                                            \n                                        \n                        \nThe post A Note from Stoic – Towerborne Arrives on Xbox Today appeared first on Xbox Wire.",

Brand new Microsoft accounts will now be “passwordless by default.” New users will have several passwordless options for signing into their account and they’ll never need to enroll a password. Existing users can visit their account settings to delete their password.\nWith today’s changes, Microsoft is renaming “World Password Day” to “World Passkey Day” instead and pledges to continue its work implementing passkeys over the coming year. This time last year, the company implemented passkeys into consumer accounts.

          "contentSnippet": "You can stream the latest season of The Last of Us on Max while saving if you subscribe to an annual plan.\n\nSo far, 2025 has been a great year for watching new, must-see TV shows and movies on subscription services. But if you, like many of us, have more concurrent subscriptions than you care to admit, you’ll agree that keeping up with the latest each month is expensive. They may not cost as much as most of the tech we cover, but it adds up.\nIf you’re trying to cut down on your expenses, you might be able to do so while holding onto your precious subscriptions. Several services offer ongoing promos, some of which are even available to new and returning subscribers alike. Below, we’ve curated some of the best deals going on right now, so you can enjoy streaming your favorite show or movie for less than it would typically cost you.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best Disney Plus deals\nThe best Hulu deals\nThe best Peacock deals\nThe best Sling TV deals\nThe best Apple TV Plus deals\nThe best Max deals\nThe best Netflix deals\nThe best YouTube TV deals\nThe best Paramount Plus and Showtime deals\nThe best Starz deals\nThe best Amazon Prime Video deals\n\nNote: keep an eye out for free trials and student discounts\nMost streaming services offer free trials that typically last from a week to a month, whether you sign up for an annual membership or just a monthly subscription. However, you will likely have to provide your credit card information in advance, and you will be charged once your trial is over, so make a note in your calendar if you don’t want to be charged.\nSome streaming platforms offer student discounts. These include Hulu, Paramount Plus, YouTube TV, Amazon Prime, and more. You’ll have to prove your student eligibility through a sign-up form and typically be enrolled in an accredited Title IV college or university to take advantage of these deals.\nThe best Disney Plus deals\nWith Disney Plus, you can stream a wide range of shows and movies, including Star Wars: Skeleton Crew, Deadpool & Wolverine, Andor, X-Men ‘97, Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man, and Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour film. A monthly subscription currently costs $9.99 a month with ads or $15.99 a month without (or $159.99 annually). The $15.99 per month service includes Dolby Atmos sound, as well as the ability to download TV shows and movies on up to 10 devices.\nFor just a dollar more, Disney offers an ad-supported, $10.99-a-month Duo Basic subscription that brings together Disney Plus and Hulu. To enjoy an ad-free experience across both services, the cost is $19.99 per month.\nThere’s also the $16.99-a-month Disney Bundle Trio Basic bundle, which includes the ad-supported Hulu and ESPN Plus (paying $26.99 a month nets you the ad-free version of Hulu and Disney Plus, though ESPN will still have ads). That’s cheaper than subscribing to all three streaming services individually, and is the wisest route to take if you want all three.\nThat being said, there are other ways to save, particularly with carrier promos. Those currently on one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans, for instance, can get Disney Plus Trio Basic with ads for $10 a month instead of $16.99. If you already subscribe to Verizon’s existing Legacy bundle, you can also continue to enjoy ad-free Disney Plus, as well as ad-supported ESPN Plus and Hulu, for $15 per month ($6 off).\nThe best Hulu deals\nHulu offers both ad-supported and ad-free plans. No matter which you buy, you’ll be able to access all of Hulu’s TV shows and movies on multiple devices, including originals like The Handmaid’s Tale and Sand Land, as well as other content, like Shogun, The Bear, Futurama, and The Veil. The service also allows two people to stream simultaneously, and you can have up to six user profiles. However, subscribing to the ad-free plan means you won’t have to deal with commercials; You’ll also be able to watch downloads offline.\nThe ad-supported plan currently costs $9.99 per month, while the ad-free plan costs $18.99 a month. Hulu also sells ad-free and ad-supported bundles that include Disney Plus and / or ESPN Plus, which are cheaper than subscribing to each service individually. With the Hulu with Live TV, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus bundle, you’ll be able to access more than 90 live sports, news, and entertainment channels, as well as content from each of the streaming services. You’ll also be able to record live shows with unlimited DVR storage and take advantage of the same features the standard, ad-free, and ad-supported Hulu plans offer. The ad-supported Hulu with Live TV subscription is $82.99 a month, while the ad-free tier is $95.99 a month (though, it’s worth noting that, of the three services included, ESPN Plus will still have ads, even at this tier). Complicated, right?\nHowever, if you just want Hulu and don’t need the live TV version, you can subscribe to the ad-supported Disney Bundle Duo Basic, which includes Disney Plus, for $10.99 a month. You can also add ESPN Plus for $16.99 per month, or get rid of ads and add live sports for $26.99 a month.\nIn terms of deals, students can subscribe to the ad-supported version for $1.99 a month or a bundle that combines Spotify Premium, Showtime, and ad-supported Hulu for $5.99 a month. Some wireless carriers are also offering customers discounts when they buy premium phone plans. As mentioned previously, those currently on one of Verizon’s Unlimited plans can get the Disney Plus Trio Basic with ads for $10 per month instead of $16.99. If you already subscribe to Verizon’s Legacy bundle, you can also continue to stream ad-free Disney Plus and ad-supported ESPN Plus / Hulu for $15 a month ($6 off). T-Mobile, meanwhile, is offers complimentary access to Hulu’s ad-supported tier when you maintain a qualifying Go5G Next line. \nThe best Peacock deals\nPeacock is NBCUniversal’s streaming service, one that offers next-day programming from NBC (and Bravo). The platform also provides access to live sports programming, including Sunday Night Football and WWE, as well as movies and shows like The Wild Robot, Conclave, Wicked, Oppenheimer, Yellowstone, Teacup, The Office, Saturday Night Live, and Rian Johnson’s Poker Face.\nThe platform currently offers two plans: an ad-supported Peacock Premium tier for $7.99 a month (or $79.99 a year) or the ad-free Peacock Premium Plus tier for $13.99 a month (or $139.99 a year). Only the latter lets you download content for offline viewing.\nIn terms of deals, you can grab a complimentary subscription when you sign up for a year of Instacart Plus ($99 annually or $9.99 a month). You can also get free access if you’re an Xfinity Internet customer with gigabit speeds or a Diamond or Platinum Rewards member.\nThe best Sling TV deals\nSling TV is a streaming service that functions as a more affordable alternative to YouTube TV and Hulu with Live TV. With it, you can watch a range of streaming services as well as live and on-demand channels — including ESPN, CNN, Fox, NBC, Comedy Central, and Cartoon Network — on multiple devices.\nSling offers an ad-supported free tier — Sling Freestream — which provides access to more than 500 live channels as well as more than 40,000 on-demand movies and TV shows. The platform also offers three paid plans, all of which come with 50 hours of DVR storage: Sling Blue ($50.99 a month); Sling Orange ($45.99 a month); and Sling Orange and Blue ($65.99 a month). Sling also lets you subscribe to Max as a Blue-tier add-on for a discount (totaling $57.97 per month), or you can buy an ad-free subscription to Max as a standalone service for $16.99 a month. \nIf you’re into sports, you may want to opt for Sling Orange over Blue as it grants access to ESPN channels — but only on one device. Sling Blue, however, offers a number of channels Sling Orange lacks, including Fox News, MSNBC, E!, Discovery, Bravo, and local NBC or Fox affiliates. You can also subscribe to a bundle that includes both Sling Orange and Sling Blue, which offers all the channels featured in the first two plans.\nSling is currently offering new customers a 50 percent discount on their first month of Sling Orange, meaning you’ll pay $23 instead of $45.99. The promo also applies to Sling Blue, although it’s slightly more expensive at $25.50, down from $50.99. You can also get one month of Sling Orange and Sling Blue combined for $33 per month instead of $65.99. In addition to 50 percent off your first month, Sling is also offering free unlimited DVR during that period, along with a $5 discount on Paramount Plus with Showtime, AMC Plus, or Starz.\nThe best Apple TV Plus deals\nApple TV Plus is a service operated by Apple that offers original shows and movies in 4K HDR, including Ted Lasso, The Studio, The Morning Show, Silo, Severance, Finch, Coda, For All Mankind, and Napoleon. The platform is also the streaming home to Major League Soccer, and currently costs $9.99 a month. There are no ads whatsoever on Apple TV Plus.\nThere are a couple of promos to make note of when it comes to Apple TV Plus. The service currently offers a weeklong free trial for new subscribers, after which you’ll be charged $9.99 a month. You can also get a free three-month subscription when you buy an Apple device, though you’ll have to redeem the offer within 90 days of purchase.\nApple TV Plus is also included in the larger Apple One suite of apps. The all-in-one service lets you bundle four other Apple services for a single monthly subscription starting at $19.95 a month. New subscribers will get a free month of Apple TV Plus if they include it as part of their Apple One membership. In addition, eligible individuals who sign up for the student Apple Music subscription, which starts at $5.99 per month, can get Apple Music for 50 percent off with a free Apple TV Plus subscription.\nAs far as carrier deals go, T-Mobile offers discounts on Apple TV Plus, as well as other streaming services. For instance, the wireless carrier is currently offering customers in the US complimentary access to Apple TV Plus when they subscribe to a qualifying Go5G Next line. For Verizon Unlimited customers, the option exists to get Apple One (which includes Apple TV Plus) for $10 per month ($9.95 off) for an individual plan, or $20 for a family plan ($5.95 off).\nThe best Max deals\nMax, formerly known as HBO Max, is home to Game of Thrones and its spinoff, House of the Dragon, along with shows and movies like Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga, Dune: Prophecy, The Last of Us, Wonka, Euphoria, Hacks, Scavenger’s Reign, The Batman, Succession, and even content from Discovery Plus.\nThe platform offers an ad-supported tier that costs $9.99 a month and two ad-free plans that start at $16.99 a month. Unlike the ad-supported plan, the standard ad-free tier also lets you download 30 shows or movies for offline viewing. Max also offers a $20.99-a-month Premium plan, which allows you to stream in 4K and supports Dolby Atmos with select content. The latter plan also lets you stream on four devices simultaneously and download a maximum of 100 shows or movies to watch on the go.\nMax offers an annual subscription and various bundles, both of which are cheaper than subscribing on a monthly basis. The ad-supported plan normally costs $99.99 a year, saving you a modest $19 over the course of 12 months, while subscribing to the annual ad-free base plan for $169.99 saves you $33. You can also save about $41 by subscribing to the annual 4K Premium ad-free plan for $209.99. Lastly, you can opt for the ad-supported bundle — which includes Max, Disney Plus, and Hulu — for $16.99 a month, or pay $13 extra to go ad-free. The total cost is cheaper than subscribing to each of the three individually, saving you money in the long run.\nFortunately, the streaming platform is running a promotion, allowing you to save even more on the cost of an annual plan. Now through May 7th, Max’s annual ad-supported Basic plan is discounted to $79.99 ($20 off), while the ad-free Standard tier is discounted to $139.99 (also $20 off). You can also subscribe to the Premium tier for $169.99, down from $209.99.\nMultiple wireless carriers are also offering deals. You can, for instance, get a year of Netflix and Max when you purchase a 5G Home Plus, LTE Home Plus, Fios 1 Gig, or the Fios 2 Gig Verizon Home Internet (VHI) plan. Alternatively, Verizon is offering those with an Unlimited plan the ability to get Netflix and Max (with ads) for $10 a month (about $7 off). \nAT&T also includes complimentary access to ad-free Max when you subscribe to select AT&T Unlimited Choice or Plus plans, which start at $60 a month. If you opt for Cricket’s Unlimited Plus 15GB Mobile Hotspot phone plan, which starts at $60 a month, you’ll also be able to get the ad-supported version of Max for free. Finally, you can get two months of Max free with DirectTV Stream or Satellite TV services.\nThe best Netflix deals\nA Netflix subscription grants you access to thousands of movies and TV shows, as well as a limited number of mobile games. Notable shows and movies include Squid Game, Dan Da Dan, Baby Reindeer, The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, Cobra Kai, Stranger Things, The Killer, and Arcane, among countless others.\nThe well-known streaming service currently offers three plans: Standard with ads ($7.99 per month), Standard without ads ($17.99 per month), and Premium ($24.99 per month). The premium tier allows for higher resolution, lets multiple users watch content on four devices at the same time as opposed to just two, and lets you download on six devices at a time as opposed to just two. It’s also the only plan that supports 4K HDR content, as well as spatial audio.\nNetflix isn’t currently offering a discount, but T-Mobile is offering the ad-supported plan for free to those on qualifying Go5G Next and Go5G Plus lines. This deal is also available to those on qualifying Magenta Max lines, or for those who sign up to two or more Go56 and Magenta lines. As mentioned previously, you can also get a year of both Netflix and Max when you purchase one of the following Verizon Home internet plans: a 5G Home Plus, LTE Home Plus, Fios 1 Gig, or the Fios 2 Gig Verizon Home Internet (VHI) plan. Alternatively, Verizon is offering those with an Unlimited plan the ability to get Netflix and Max (with ads) for $10 per month ($6.98 off). \nThe best YouTube TV deals\nYouTube TV grants subscribers access to live sports and a number of major news and entertainment channels, including PBS, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, NBC, ABC, Fox, CNN, and more. It also comes with unlimited recording for a maximum of six accounts, all for $82.99 per month. You can buy optional add-ons as well, which range between $2 and $65 a month and include access to services like Max, Starz, and NBA League Pass. The service also offers a separate Spanish-only plan.\nNow through July 31st, new subscribers can sign up for the YouTube TV Base Plan for $59.99 ($23 off) a month for the first two months. It’ll be free for 21 days as a trial.\nThe best Paramount Plus and Showtime deals\nParamount Plus and Showtime provides access to live sports and 24/7 live news with CBS News. It also grants access to the entire Paramount Plus catalog, including shows like Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Yellowstone spinoff 1923, as well as films like Gladiator II and Top Gun: Maverick. You’ll also get access to Showtime’s library, which includes originals like Billions, Dexter: Resurrection, and Yellowjackets, as well as movies like Talk To Me and Past Lives.\nIf you want to subscribe to both Paramount Plus and Showtime, you can sign up for the ad-free Paramount Plus with Showtime package for $12.99 a month (it comes with a one-week trial). Alternatively, if you’re willing to pay upfront, you can save about $36 over the course of a year when you subscribe to the annual plan for $119.99 per year.\nAlternatively, you can subscribe to Paramount Plus as a standalone service when you pay for Paramount Plus’ ad-supported Essential plan, which costs $7.99 per month (it, too, comes with a one-week trial for new subscribers). The annual plan, meanwhile, costs $59.99 per year, saving you $36 over the course of 12 months if you’re willing to pay upfront. Just bear in mind this plan offers fewer live sporting events than the Paramount Plus with Showtime package, and won’t let you download content for offline viewing.\nIn terms of deals, Walmart Plus subscribers can currently get the Essential plan for free as part of their subscription. College students can also subscribe to the Essential plan for $5.99 ($2 off) a month, while seniors with an AARP membership can get a 10 percent discount on the Essential plan or Paramount Plus with Showtime plan. Lastly, military members can get a 50 percent discount on a year of the Essential or Paramount Plus with Showtime plans.\nThe best Starz deals\nWith Starz, you can stream a variety of shows and movies, including John Wick: Chapter 4, M3GAN, and Asteroid City, as well as originals like Outlander and Sweetpea. The platform offers a single ad-free plan for $10.99 per month, which allows you to stream on up to four devices simultaneously and download content for offline viewing. Right now, however, new subscribers can get three months of Starz for $4.99 per month. Alternatively, you can sign up for a six-month plan for $17.99, a savings of $28.\nThe best Amazon Prime Video deals\nAmazon Prime Video is an on-demand streaming service owned by Amazon. Its library includes a range of movies, some live content, and shows like Fallout, The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, The Boys, The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and more. Through the service, you can watch certain titles in 4K and take advantage of deals on rentals and purchases not included in the subscription. There’s also an option to add extra channels with Prime Video channels, or go ad-free for an additional $2.99 a month.\nAmazon Prime Video is included with an Amazon Prime membership, though you can sign up for the service without a membership for $8.99 a month with ads or $11.98 without. Right now, customers of Metro By T-Mobile’s unlimited plan can also get a free Amazon Prime membership, which provides access to Prime Video and other benefits, for free.\nUpdate, May 1st: Adjusted relevant pricing details and added a new Max promo.",

At a time when developers are aiming for as little loading as possible, it remains a big part of the Bethesda game experience. Just look at \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/starfield\"\u003EStarfield\u003C/a\u003E, Bethesda’s first brand new IP in years, and of course the recently released \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered\"\u003EThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered\u003C/a\u003E, which is going down very well with fans.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWith the advent of SSDs and improvements in technology, spending a lot of time waiting for a loading screen to do its business in a video game can feel archaic in 2025. But one former Bethesda developer has cautioned that they will probably always be a part of Bethesda games because of the way Bethesda games are designed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAs fans of the studio’s work will know, Bethesda games are open-world RPGs that involve opening lots and lots of doors. Want to go into that house over there? You’ll probably need to trigger a loading screen to open the door. Fast travel is always a loading screen, although it can be made faster with more powerful hardware. Sometimes just leaving one area and going to another area in a Bethesda game triggers loading.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Csection data-transform=\"ignvideo\" data-slug=\"the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-7-things-it-doesnt-tell-you\" data-loop=\"\"\u003E\u003C/section\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBruce Nesmith, who worked at Bethesda on everything from Oblivion to Starfield, told \u003Ca href=\"https://www.videogamer.com/features/former-skyrim-lead-defends-bethesda-loading-screens-necessary-bane/\"\u003EVideoGamer\u003C/a\u003E that segmentation is an important part of Bethesda game design, and so using zone loading is too.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EA totally seamless open-world isn’t feasible for the type of RPGs Bethesda makes, Nesmith continued, because segmented areas backed by loading lets the games keep track of item placement and physics states after the player leaves an area, which helps create the sense of leaving a permanent mark on the virtual world.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“Everybody who complains about them assumes that it’s done because we’re lazy or we don’t want to follow the modern thinking on stuff,” Nesmith said. “The reality is the Bethesda games are so detailed and so graphics intensive… you just can&#39;t have both present at the same time.”\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“I can’t have the interiors of all these places loaded at the same time as the exteriors,” Nesmith continued. “That’s just not an option. And all the fancy tricks for streaming and loading and all that, you end up with hitching. So you’re actually better off stopping the game briefly, doing a loading screen and then continuing on.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“If you make a game that has less going on, it’s a tighter experience and not a [true] open-world experience. So it’s just one of those necessary evils, as it were, it’s not that anybody at Bethesda ever wanted to do it. We just didn’t have a choice, really, if the game was going to have the experience we wanted it to have.”\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENesmith said the use of loading screens in Bethesda’s RPGs have been “a necessary bane of the existence of Bethesda since time immemorial.&quot;\u003C/p\u003E\u003Csection data-transform=\"ignvideo\" data-slug=\"from-elder-scrolls-to-starfield-how-bethesda-defined-the-role-playing-game\" data-loop=\"\"\u003E\u003C/section\u003E\u003Cp\u003EDespite this, when Starfield launched in 2023, fans were surprised by just how often you’d trigger loading, from on-foot traversal to simply heading into city buildings. Players said Starfield’s loading broke immersion and added frustrating pauses to gameplay, and modders worked to remove as much of it as possible in the years since.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ign.com/wikis/starfield/Neon_City_Guide\"\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecity of Neon\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/a\u003E was a focus of the loading complaints. This cyberpunk-style urban area would often trigger a loading screen just for opening doors, some near to each other, which made questing annoying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut did it have to be this way? Last year, Nate Purkeypile, who worked at Bethesda Game Studios from 2007 before leaving in 2021, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-starfield-dev-surprised-by-how-much-loading-the-game-launched-with\"\u003Eexpressed his surprise at the sheer amount of loading the game ended up launching with\u003C/a\u003E, particularly in the city of Neon.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“It could have existed without those [loading zones],” Purkeypile said. “Like, some of those were not there when I had been working on it and so it was a surprise to me that there was as many as there were.”\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESo, why did Starfield launch with so many loading screens? Purkeypile said part of the segmentation of the game has to do with the way the Creation Engine, which Bethesda uses to make its games, works, and that has a lot to do with performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“A lot of it is gating stuff off for performance in Neon,” Purkeypile confirmed.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Csection data-transform=\"poll\" data-id=\"11e0c5d1-8d01-4d4b-b7b1-9fbe04b84dfd\"\u003E\u003C/section\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAhead of Starfield’s launch, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-starfield-performance-and-frame-rate-on-xbox-series-x-and-s\"\u003E\u003Cu\u003EBethesda development chief Todd Howard revealed that the game would release locked at 30 frames per second on both Xbox Series X and S\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/a\u003E to ensure “consistency” of performance.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“I think it&#39;ll come as no surprise, given our previous games, what we go for,” Howard said at the time. “Always these huge, open worlds, fully dynamic, hyper detail where anything can happen. And we do want to do that. It&#39;s 4K in the X. It&#39;s 1440 on the S. We do lock it at 30, because we want that fidelity, we want all that stuff. We don&#39;t want to sacrifice any of it.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E“Fortunately in this one, we&#39;ve got it running great. It&#39;s often running way above that. Sometimes it&#39;s 60.

          "content:encodedSnippet": "Bethesda games are known for their sometimes lengthy loading screens. At a time when developers are aiming for as little loading as possible, it remains a big part of the Bethesda game experience. Just look at Starfield, Bethesda’s first brand new IP in years, and of course the recently released The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, which is going down very well with fans.\nWith the advent of SSDs and improvements in technology, spending a lot of time waiting for a loading screen to do its business in a video game can feel archaic in 2025. But one former Bethesda developer has cautioned that they will probably always be a part of Bethesda games because of the way Bethesda games are designed.\nAs fans of the studio’s work will know, Bethesda games are open-world RPGs that involve opening lots and lots of doors. Want to go into that house over there? You’ll probably need to trigger a loading screen to open the door. Fast travel is always a loading screen, although it can be made faster with more powerful hardware. Sometimes just leaving one area and going to another area in a Bethesda game triggers loading.\n\nBruce Nesmith, who worked at Bethesda on everything from Oblivion to Starfield, told VideoGamer that segmentation is an important part of Bethesda game design, and so using zone loading is too.\nA totally seamless open-world isn’t feasible for the type of RPGs Bethesda makes, Nesmith continued, because segmented areas backed by loading lets the games keep track of item placement and physics states after the player leaves an area, which helps create the sense of leaving a permanent mark on the virtual world.\n“Everybody who complains about them assumes that it’s done because we’re lazy or we don’t want to follow the modern thinking on stuff,” Nesmith said. “The reality is the Bethesda games are so detailed and so graphics intensive… you just can't have both present at the same time.”\n“I can’t have the interiors of all these places loaded at the same time as the exteriors,” Nesmith continued. “That’s just not an option. And all the fancy tricks for streaming and loading and all that, you end up with hitching. So you’re actually better off stopping the game briefly, doing a loading screen and then continuing on.\n“If you make a game that has less going on, it’s a tighter experience and not a [true] open-world experience. So it’s just one of those necessary evils, as it were, it’s not that anybody at Bethesda ever wanted to do it. We just didn’t have a choice, really, if the game was going to have the experience we wanted it to have.”\nNesmith said the use of loading screens in Bethesda’s RPGs have been “a necessary bane of the existence of Bethesda since time immemorial.\"\n\nDespite this, when Starfield launched in 2023, fans were surprised by just how often you’d trigger loading, from on-foot traversal to simply heading into city buildings. Players said Starfield’s loading broke immersion and added frustrating pauses to gameplay, and modders worked to remove as much of it as possible in the years since.\nThe city of Neon was a focus of the loading complaints. This cyberpunk-style urban area would often trigger a loading screen just for opening doors, some near to each other, which made questing annoying.\nBut did it have to be this way? Last year, Nate Purkeypile, who worked at Bethesda Game Studios from 2007 before leaving in 2021, expressed his surprise at the sheer amount of loading the game ended up launching with, particularly in the city of Neon.\n“It could have existed without those [loading zones],” Purkeypile said. “Like, some of those were not there when I had been working on it and so it was a surprise to me that there was as many as there were.”\nSo, why did Starfield launch with so many loading screens? Purkeypile said part of the segmentation of the game has to do with the way the Creation Engine, which Bethesda uses to make its games, works, and that has a lot to do with performance.\n“A lot of it is gating stuff off for performance in Neon,” Purkeypile confirmed.\n\nAhead of Starfield’s launch, Bethesda development chief Todd Howard revealed that the game would release locked at 30 frames per second on both Xbox Series X and S to ensure “consistency” of performance.\n“I think it'll come as no surprise, given our previous games, what we go for,” Howard said at the time. “Always these huge, open worlds, fully dynamic, hyper detail where anything can happen. And we do want to do that. It's 4K in the X. It's 1440 on the S. We do lock it at 30, because we want that fidelity, we want all that stuff. We don't want to sacrifice any of it.\n“Fortunately in this one, we've got it running great. It's often running way above that. Sometimes it's 60. But on the consoles, we do lock it because we prefer the consistency, where you're not even thinking about it.\n“And we don't ever want to sacrifice that experience that makes our games feel really, really special. So it feels great. We're really happy with how it feels even in the heat of battle. And we need that headroom because in our games, really anything can happen.”\nSince launch, Bethesda has worked to improve the game, with 60fps now possible as part of performance mode.\nThe question will be whether Bethesda can make meaningful improvements to loading screens for The Elder Scrolls VI, which fans hope will mark a significant level up for the studio’s technology.\nWhile you wait to find out, we’ve got plenty more on Oblivion Remastered, including a report on a player who managed to escape the confines of Cyrodiil to explore Valenwood, Skyrim, and even Hammerfell, the rumored setting of The Elder Scrolls VI.\nWe've also got a comprehensive guide to everything you'll find in Oblivion Remastered, including an expansive Interactive Map, complete Walkthroughs for the Main Questline and every Guild Quest, How to Build the Perfect Character, Things to Do First, every PC Cheat Code, and much more.\n\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

The extremely mid Elder Scrolls spinoffs, like the co-op focused Battlespire and swashbuckling action-adventure Redguard, need not apply here. Nor do mobile games like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/23/the-elder-scrolls-blades-early-access-review\"\u003EThe Elder Scrolls Blades\u003C/a\u003E and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/26/fallout-shelter-review\"\u003EFallout Shelter\u003C/a\u003E, although I’ve definitely got a soft spot for the latter game’s dark humor and infinite armies of cartoon dwellers captured in the charming Vault Boy style.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENo, this list is for the heavy hitters, the sprawling, prestige sandboxes that immediately come to mind when one thinks of a capital B, capital G “Bethesda Game,” though admittedly we’re starting out on a rather humble foot with…\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E9: Elder Scrolls: Arena\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe first entry in the franchise isn’t last because it’s a bad game, it’s last because nobody knew what they were doing. The Bethesda of 1994 had basically only made sports and Terminator games, and Arena was kind of a mix of both. Originally, you traveled the world competing in medieval gladiator battles, doing the odd sidequest on the side. The developers quickly realised it would be a cool idea if your fighters could walk around the cities, talk to the people who live there, and dive into incredibly difficult dungeons on their behalf.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe result is an impressive little first-person RPG that’s very much of its era, a “where-the-hell-do-I-go-em-up” in the vein of Ultima Underworld and Might and Magic.

The movement and shooting feels crisp and responsive compared to its clunky predecessors, and the Commonwealth is more than a worthy environment to explore. A new system that allows you to design and build your own settlements is an impressive addition to Bethesda’s aging tech, though it’s a coin flip as to whether you’ll find it fun or a complete waste of time. The game looks and sounds spectacular, and was arguably the most polished launch product Bethesda produced since… \u003Cem\u003Eever\u003C/em\u003E. Some of its expansions, particularly Far Harbor, seemed to capture that old Fallout feeling, and there’s at least one all-time classic character to emerge out of the crowd of Bostonian blandness and micromanaging Minutemen in the form of android private eye Nick Valentine.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe storyline, revolving around high-tech synthetic humans teleporting from a crisp and clean underground lab, is at odds with the grungy atompunk flavor of the Fallout universe, and the bizarre twist involving the identity of your character’s missing son was both blindingly obvious and incredibly dumb. The whole experience feels like a Fallout-flavored theme park ride, plopping you in power armor to face off with a deathclaw within the first hour of gameplay. From there, the game parades you through a series of shallow choices and uninteresting factions until you pick who you’re going to side with and watch the uninspired endings play out.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe biggest detriment to the game has to be the dialogue system. The first Fallout, famously, allows for all sorts of freedom in how the Vault Dweller interacts with the world around them, from monosyllabic grunts to talking the super mutant Master into unaliving himself in the final boss battle. Fallout 4, on the other hand, made the dubious decision to voice all of our protagonist’s interaction, severely limiting their options. Even worse, the four choices offered in response to any situation usually boil down to nice, rude, neutral, and “tell me more.” It’s a disappointing devolution of the RPG formula, but not entirely unsurprising given Bethesda’s first Fallout game.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Csection data-transform=\"object-card\" data-id=\"f6116514-57c1-4349-8105-c1e784aea5d7\"\u003E\u003C/section\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E4: Fallout 3\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhen Bethesda \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPt08UYmyMo\"\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eannounced\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/a\u003E it had purchased the rights to the dormant Fallout franchise in 2004, fans went nuclear.

The intro also serves as a tutorial for the V.A.T.S. system, maybe Bethesda’s most brilliant addition to the franchise. The isometric, turn-based Fallout games allowed your character to target individual body parts in combat, allowing for agonizing and often hilarious precision shots. In the leap to first person, BSG compensates for their somewhat muddy controls by letting us freeze time and select precisely where we’d like our strikes to land in one of the most elegant translations of a game mechanic from 2D to 3D ever.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ENot everything in Fallout 3 is as successful as V.A.T.S., however. The Capital Wasteland is a fantastic map filled with recognizably ruined national landmarks, but it’s also stuffed with repetitive encounters in subways and sewers awash in a hideous green filter that was all the rage in the early aughts. There are meaningful choices with megaton consequences that ultimately railroad you into an utterly ludicrous ending scenario that requires you to sacrifice your life to radiation while your radiation-immune supermutant friend watches from a safe distance A conclusion that was so derided, Bethesda would eventually patch it by way of the Broken Steel DLC.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EIt’s the very best and very worst of Bethesda’s instincts laid bare, and the awkward friction integrating BGS’s environmental storytelling with Fallout’s anarchic RPG flavor makes vanilla Fallout 3 a rather unpleasant experience today.

Skyrim isn’t a game you have to recommend with huge caveats to your friend who mostly plays Warzone, it sacrificed just enough of its systems to smooth out its friction points and in the process became an all-time best seller.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis isn’t to say that it should be ranked highly just because it made a ton of money, but rather that it made a ton of money because of how well it struck a balance between accessibility and depth, allowing players of all kinds to immerse themselves in an intricately crafted world and live out that timeless, universal fantasy of slaying dragons. But with all due respect to Skyrim’s successful efforts to make the game accessible to the mainstream, our number one spot goes to the game that achieved the exact opposite.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EBut first...\u003C/p\u003E\u003Csection data-transform=\"object-card\" data-id=\"59a9e67a-4d46-4f93-af42-1e33e7d719e5\"\u003E\u003C/section\u003E\u003Ch2\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EHonorable Mention: Fallout: New Vegas\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWe couldn’t in good faith leave this list without mentioning \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/10/19/fallout-new-vegas-review\"\u003Ethe best Fallout game ever made\u003C/a\u003E.

So, commence dragonshouting your favorites in the comments below!\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/section\u003E",
          "content:encodedSnippet": "It’s rare that a developer becomes synonymous with a single genre, but Bethesda has its signature style so locked down it’s a wonder we don’t just call the entire field of first-person open-world Western RPGs “Skyrimlikes” or “Oblivionvanias.” In the three decades since The Elder Scrolls: Arena debuted, Bethesda Game Studios has emerged as a juggernaut in the triple-A space, earning a rabid fanbase, massive sales, and a $7.5 billion acquisition from Microsoft, solely on the strength of its tried and true design principles.\n\nBethesda’s been responsible for some big hits and even bigger misses over the years, and since the shocking (but not really) release of The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion Remaster has us all rethinking our long-calcified tier-lists, we thought it was time to take a fresh look at ranking the studio’s output. It’s gonna be a long, long time before The Elder Scrolls VI is anything more than a dramatically and perhaps prematurely revealed logo, and while that’s a bummer for everyone dying to play it, at least it means this list won’t be obsolete anytime soon. \n\nBefore we start, we should clarify that we’re strictly talking about Bethesda’s trademark RPGs on this list. The extremely mid Elder Scrolls spinoffs, like the co-op focused Battlespire and swashbuckling action-adventure Redguard, need not apply here. Nor do mobile games like The Elder Scrolls Blades and Fallout Shelter, although I’ve definitely got a soft spot for the latter game’s dark humor and infinite armies of cartoon dwellers captured in the charming Vault Boy style.\n\nNo, this list is for the heavy hitters, the sprawling, prestige sandboxes that immediately come to mind when one thinks of a capital B, capital G “Bethesda Game,” though admittedly we’re starting out on a rather humble foot with…\n\n9: Elder Scrolls: Arena\nThe first entry in the franchise isn’t last because it’s a bad game, it’s last because nobody knew what they were doing. The Bethesda of 1994 had basically only made sports and Terminator games, and Arena was kind of a mix of both. Originally, you traveled the world competing in medieval gladiator battles, doing the odd sidequest on the side. The developers quickly realised it would be a cool idea if your fighters could walk around the cities, talk to the people who live there, and dive into incredibly difficult dungeons on their behalf.\n\nThe result is an impressive little first-person RPG that’s very much of its era, a “where-the-hell-do-I-go-em-up” in the vein of Ultima Underworld and Might and Magic. Arena has loads of arcane systems and randomized loot, meandering, maddening, sidequests, and extremely clunky movement that will make you forget everything you’ve ever learned about using a mouse. \n\nAnd given how bad the combat is, the kind of stats-based melee that sees you visually landing hit after hit on rampaging skeletons only to deal no damage thanks to a dice roll, maybe it’s a good thing the developers dropped the whole “gladiator” concept for Arena. Less fortunately, they didn’t drop it fast enough to change the title, since all the marketing materials were already printed up. The best they could do was tack on a “chapter one” and make it seem like the game was part of a larger saga about all-knowing Elder Scrolls.\n\nDeclaring your debut the start of a new franchise is a gutsy move that more often than not ends in failure, but the extremely flawed Arena was still successful enough to set Bethesda on a path that would fulfill its prediction, and boldly go beyond.\n\n8: Starfield\nWith every new BGS game comes rumors and discourse on whether this will be the one that finally ditches their aging “Gamebryo” engine, or at least updates the notoriously inefficient cell-based framework beyond its well-known limits. Starfield did not. “Creation Engine 2.0” might have a fancy new name and a pretty new animation pipeline, but at the end of the day you’re still staring at a loading screen every time you step into a store.\n\nThe NASApunk sci-fi setting was a welcome departure from the low-tech locales of Tamriel and the Wasteland, even though it’s starting to wear out its welcome, but it’s ill-suited for Bethesda’s style. They’re great at creating one big connected world, full of discoveries, nooks and crannies, and intricately staged skeletons with nearby flavor notes. Instead, Starfield boasts 1,000 procedurally generated planets with what feels like a dozen different points of interest repeated between them. \n\nNow, we've solved more than a few dragon claw puzzles in our day, but somehow that never felt as aggravating as landing on a new planet and stumbling across another abandoned cryo lab or mine. Dear god, the mines. If you’re bored in a samey Draugr dungeon, you can just walk to something cool around the corner. But in Starfield you’re just kinda stuck dejectedly wiping out the pirates, hoofing it back to your spaceship, and blasting off with a sigh.\n\nIt might seem harsh to place Starfield so close to something as primitive as Arena, but it’s easier to forgive the shortcomings of a gallant first effort from an inexperienced team than those of a $200 million triple-A behemoth that promised the moon and failed to deliver.\n\n7: Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall\nOne reason the procedural generation in Starfield is such a bummer is that Bethesda has so much experience with it going way, way back. In fact, its second RPG ever is one of the most impressive feats of algorithmic open world creation that ever existed, and it came out in 1997.\n\nThe map in Skyrim translates to about 15 square miles, and that’s actually on the smaller side compared to games that came out in its wake. Breath of the Wild and Grand Theft Auto 5’s are both around 30 square miles, give or take. The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall is 80,000 square miles, roughly the size of Great Britain. It’ll take you 69 hours to walk across the entire thing, though it’ll go slightly quicker if you’re okay with staring at the back of this horse's head for days on end as your precious time on Earth slowly whittles away.\n\nThe world is vast, sparse, and kind of ugly, but it’s definitely not empty. The Iliac Bay area contains nine distinct climates, 44 different political regions, and 15,000 points of interest scattered throughout. We’re talking 4,000 dungeons and 5,000 cities or towns populated with hundreds of quests and non-player-characters. Needless to say, there’s a touch of wonky proc-gen involved.\n\nBut what good is a huge world if it’s a slog to move around in? The dungeon-crawling combat is only slightly improved, though the debut of the series’ trademark “improve your stats as you use their skills” progression system is definitely appreciated. In Daggerfall, it’s the experience above ground that made the biggest leap in quality. You can buy houses and boats, join guilds, steal and murder to your heart's content and deal with the consequences. While it’s all relatively simple and extremely opaque, the opportunities for immersion within Daggerfall almost make you wish you could explore it with a friend or two. Almost.\n\n6: Fallout 76\nYou might be confused as to why Fallout 76 is on this list at all, given that it’s more of a live service, multiplayer looter-shooter than an epic, story-driven RPG experience, and if you haven’t played it for a while that’s totally fair. The game was a straight-up disaster at launch, omitting hand-crafted dialogue and non-player characters in the hopes that griefing online randos would be able to provide the flavor that makes Fallout’s wastelands so worthwhile. This was a mistake, to put it mildly, and just one of many. From aggravating loot limits and endless crafting to questionable pricing practices, Fallout 76 was a dud when it debuted in 2018, thanks in no small part to a grueling development cycle that plagued the project from the start.\n\nThings have changed, however. The Wastelanders update added voiced NPCs to the experience, so many in fact that technically it has the most characters of any game in the whole series. Whether they have anything worthwhile to say is still up for debate but they’re there, along with tweaks to the loot system and overall experience that make it less of a slog and more of a passable RPG to play with friends. The game has developed a healthy following, especially in the wake of Amazon’s hit Fallout TV series, but even so, it’s hard to rank Fallout 76 very high given the existence of the superior Elder Scrolls Online, Bethesda’s long-running MMO that only failed to make the cut here because it was developed out of house by Zenimax Online Studios.\n\nFallout 76’s pivot towards live-service, revenue-generating, trend-chasing slop gave fans grave doubts about Bethesda’s stewardship of the Fallout franchise, but they didn’t exist in a vacuum. Discontent had been brewing for a long time, even as sales skyrocketed.\n\n5: Fallout 4\nAt 25 million copies sold, Fallout 4 is the most successful game in the series by a wide, wide margin, beyond the wildest dreams of Tim Cain and the rest of the Interplay/Black Isle crew that created the original isometric RPGs in the ’90s, though that success comes with a cost. Streamlined gameplay and welcome quality-of-life features can turn a niche cult classic into a mainstream blockbuster, but balancing that accessibility without sacrificing depth and complexity is no easy task. Fallout 4 fails in that regard.\n\nFirst, the good: Fallout 4 feels great. The movement and shooting feels crisp and responsive compared to its clunky predecessors, and the Commonwealth is more than a worthy environment to explore. A new system that allows you to design and build your own settlements is an impressive addition to Bethesda’s aging tech, though it’s a coin flip as to whether you’ll find it fun or a complete waste of time. The game looks and sounds spectacular, and was arguably the most polished launch product Bethesda produced since… ever. Some of its expansions, particularly Far Harbor, seemed to capture that old Fallout feeling, and there’s at least one all-time classic character to emerge out of the crowd of Bostonian blandness and micromanaging Minutemen in the form of android private eye Nick Valentine.\n\nThe storyline, revolving around high-tech synthetic humans teleporting from a crisp and clean underground lab, is at odds with the grungy atompunk flavor of the Fallout universe, and the bizarre twist involving the identity of your character’s missing son was both blindingly obvious and incredibly dumb. The whole experience feels like a Fallout-flavored theme park ride, plopping you in power armor to face off with a deathclaw within the first hour of gameplay. From there, the game parades you through a series of shallow choices and uninteresting factions until you pick who you’re going to side with and watch the uninspired endings play out.\n\nThe biggest detriment to the game has to be the dialogue system. The first Fallout, famously, allows for all sorts of freedom in how the Vault Dweller interacts with the world around them, from monosyllabic grunts to talking the super mutant Master into unaliving himself in the final boss battle. Fallout 4, on the other hand, made the dubious decision to voice all of our protagonist’s interaction, severely limiting their options. Even worse, the four choices offered in response to any situation usually boil down to nice, rude, neutral, and “tell me more.” It’s a disappointing devolution of the RPG formula, but not entirely unsurprising given Bethesda’s first Fallout game.\n\n4: Fallout 3\nWhen Bethesda announced it had purchased the rights to the dormant Fallout franchise in 2004, fans went nuclear. For some, Fallout seemed like a perfect fit for the devs that wrote the book on systemic open world sandboxes, but there was a sizeable contingent of gatekeeping grognards who were a little more wary, warning that the Bethesda crew would tone done the anarchic spirit of the first two games for a more bland experience in hopes of capturing a more casual audience. The end result was a little bit of both.\n\nThe revival starts out extremely strong, with an opening sequence that begins with your character exiting the womb and then gives a quick crash course in all that life inside Vault 101 has to offer, from bullies to birthday parties. The intro also serves as a tutorial for the V.A.T.S. system, maybe Bethesda’s most brilliant addition to the franchise. The isometric, turn-based Fallout games allowed your character to target individual body parts in combat, allowing for agonizing and often hilarious precision shots. In the leap to first person, BSG compensates for their somewhat muddy controls by letting us freeze time and select precisely where we’d like our strikes to land in one of the most elegant translations of a game mechanic from 2D to 3D ever.\n \nNot everything in Fallout 3 is as successful as V.A.T.S., however. The Capital Wasteland is a fantastic map filled with recognizably ruined national landmarks, but it’s also stuffed with repetitive encounters in subways and sewers awash in a hideous green filter that was all the rage in the early aughts. There are meaningful choices with megaton consequences that ultimately railroad you into an utterly ludicrous ending scenario that requires you to sacrifice your life to radiation while your radiation-immune supermutant friend watches from a safe distance A conclusion that was so derided, Bethesda would eventually patch it by way of the Broken Steel DLC.\n\nIt’s the very best and very worst of Bethesda’s instincts laid bare, and the awkward friction integrating BGS’s environmental storytelling with Fallout’s anarchic RPG flavor makes vanilla Fallout 3 a rather unpleasant experience today. An excellent alternative is theTale of Two Wastelands mod that fuses Fallout 3 together with Obsidian Entertainment’s fan-favorite Fallout: New Vegas to create a single massive game. Or if that’s too much of a hassle, you could just wait for the all-but-confirmed remake that’s coming in the wake of Oblivion Remastered. Speaking of which…\n\n3: The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion\nThis was a tough call. Many of Oblivion’s adoring fans might find it blasphemous to be placed before Skyrim, while haters might contest that some of the Fallouts are superior. The truth, as always, is subjective, except for on ranking lists like this, which are infallible, definitive, scientifically determined and legally binding so let’s see how it stacks up.\n\nOblivion is the foundation of modern Bethesda games. Morrowind, obviously, came before, but it’s notable that Fallout, Starfield, and every Bethesda game (and Bethesda wannabe) since 2006 have used Oblivion as the template rather than its predecessor. The awkward pause and zoom in to start a conversation, the OP dominance of stealth archery, the ramping-up power fantasy designed to make a lowly prisoner feel like the most important being in all of Tamriel… It’s all here in pretty much its final form, though with lots of room for improvement.\n\nThe main plot sees you fending off a demonic Daedric invasion alongside a Sean Bean-voiced bastard in a cinematic saga that borrows bigtime vibes from Peter Jackson’s wildly popular Lord of the Rings trilogy. But it’s the sidequests, particularly those involving the guilds, that really elevate Oblivion. They’re all really solid in Skyrim, too, but Oblivion’s individual missions have a lot more going for them. \n\nInstead of Skyrim’s fairly rote assassinations on behalf of the Dark Mother, your devotion to the Dark Brotherhood in Oblivion is tested by specific kill conditions that make you feel like an Argonian Agent 47. Meanwhile,  while Skyrim’s introduction to the Thieves Guild effectively amounts to getting approached by a recruiter, in Oblivion, it only exists as shadows and rumors, the only clues to their existence are scattered posters and urban legends. You have to work to seek them out. \n\nSo why did we rank Oblivion below Skyrim? Maybe it’s the eye-searing ugly bloom of the XBox 360 era, or the dorky potato-faced characters stumbling through their lines. It could be the ill-conceived progression system that forces you to grind minor skills for fear of losing precious stat points when you level up, or the repetitive trudging through endless Oblivion gates. Of course, all of that can change with a remake. \n\nThe Oblivion Remaster goes a long way towards modernizing the game, with a slick UI, gorgeous new graphics, a more forgiving level-up system, and a deeply appreciated sprint button. Gone is the blinding haze of the seventh console generation, replaced with a solid Unreal Engine sheen. Unlike a lot of remasters, Oblivion maintains its awkward charms, for better or for worse. \n\nThe enemy scaling is sadly still intact, meaning you’ll find yourself running into gangs of filthy bandits bearing glass and Daedric gear. Most of the frustrating minigames have been retained, and the combat still feels strange by modern standards. But would Oblivion really be Oblivion without the jank? Without expensive horse armor and actors flubbing their lines? \n\nThe Oblivion Remaster is still the same game. It might be a little too early to tell if the remaster will be worthy of a higher spot than Skyrim, but there’s a fundamental difference between the two games that’s more than just skin deep.\n\n2: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim\nFor all of its triumphs, Skyrim loses a lot of what makes the older Elder Scroll games so special. The quests are more shallow, your character build isn’t as customizable, and your choices matter even less. You can quickly become the leader of every single guild, and the biggest decision of the game is who you want to back in the Skyrim Civil War, which culminates in an epic battle of about 40 dudes clipping into each other outside of Whiterun.\n\nIn exchange for the simplification, Skyrim received massive, undeniable improvements to the moment-to-moment gameplay. You can dash across the landscape and glitch hop your way up mountains. Additions like dual wielding and weapon crafting finally make the kinetic act of combat enjoyable in itself, and the brilliant addition of shouts allows you to drop dragons out of the sky and blast guards into the horizon with a single squeeze of a shoulder button. Clearly, the game was designed with controllers in mind, as a glance at the oft-maligned default interface will tell you, but that brings with it a tactile and responsive game feel that Skyrim’s PC-first counterparts lack. Skyrim simply feels better.\n\nBut the real secret that separates Skyrim from Oblivion is its space. In past lore, Oblivion’s setting of Cyrodiil was an endless jungle of East Asian and Mesoamerican-influenced aesthetics. In the game itself, it’s basically England. Green forests, grassy fields, and the odd Ayleid Ruin dot a landscape that fails to leave much of an impression compared to Skyrim’s frozen tundra. The mechanical depths of the Dwemer ruins, the hazy valleys of the Rift, and the glaciers of Winterhold, all feel like part of a cohesive whole. Skyrim’s geography becomes second nature as you climb enormous mountains and explore endless caves, all the while knowing that the warm glow of Whiterun at night is just a cozy walk away.\n\nFrankly, it’s a place you wouldn’t mind settling down and living out your days in a comfy Lakeview Manor, raising honey bees with your werewolf wife at your side. It’s no wonder so many people found themselves lost in Skyrim over the years, compelled to purchase the game over and over again with each slightly-improved release. For many, Skyrim and its suite of mods are the first thing to install on any new computer, just so you know it’s there – a true “forever game.”\n\nSkyrim is the game that turned the Elder Scrolls from a successful but nerdy RPG franchise into a blockbuster AAA giant. It’s like comparing Dark Souls to Elden Ring. Similar to Oblivion, Dark Souls is probably the better game on paper, but in terms of impact, the refinement that led to Elden Ring and Skyrim allowed the games to simultaneously expand in scope and reach the widest audience possible. Skyrim isn’t a game you have to recommend with huge caveats to your friend who mostly plays Warzone, it sacrificed just enough of its systems to smooth out its friction points and in the process became an all-time best seller.\n\nThis isn’t to say that it should be ranked highly just because it made a ton of money, but rather that it made a ton of money because of how well it struck a balance between accessibility and depth, allowing players of all kinds to immerse themselves in an intricately crafted world and live out that timeless, universal fantasy of slaying dragons. But with all due respect to Skyrim’s successful efforts to make the game accessible to the mainstream, our number one spot goes to the game that achieved the exact opposite.\n\nBut first...\n\nHonorable Mention: Fallout: New Vegas\nWe couldn’t in good faith leave this list without mentioning the best Fallout game ever made. Even if it was developed by Obsidian, it’s built on Bethesda’s bugs-and-all engine and wouldn’t exist without the other games on this list, even though it’s better than all of them. A near-perfect marriage of old-school sensibility and BGS open-world quirkiness, you don’t want to miss this one, especially if you plan on watching season 2 of the show.\n\nWhich brings us to the greatest Bethesda game of all time, coming in hot from the isle of Vvardenfell, it simply must be…\n\n1: The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind\nFor a game that we’re definitively calling the greatest Elder Scrolls game of all time, it’s far from the most polished or accessible. The combat retains much of the RNG aggravation of earlier games, and The UI, cluttered with resizable windows and long lists of dialogue choices to scroll through, borders on utter madness.

Pay 13 dollars or more to unlock 10 Steam titles including RollerCoaster Tycoon 3, Frostpunk, Mad Games Tycoon 2, and PlateUp. \nThe bundle also includes coupons for 35 percent off Frostpunk 2 and 10 percent off Farm Manager World. A portion of every purchase goes to No Kid Hungry, so it's a great way to expand your library while supporting a good cause.\n\n2024 Trick or Trade BOOster Bundle\n\n\nPokémon TCG Trick or Trade BOOster Bundle is down to just 15.93 at Walmart, marked down from 39.99. This seasonal bundle includes 35 mini booster packs, each with three cards, all featuring Halloween-themed art and spooky packaging. \nIt’s a fun and affordable option for parents, party hosts, or collectors looking to stock up ahead of October. With over 24 dollars in savings, this is one of the best prices you’ll find for bulk Pokémon packs.\n\nPokemon TCG Classic Box\n\n\nPokémon TCG Classic Box is now just $194.76 at Sam’s Club, a major drop from its original 400 dollar price. This deluxe set includes three 60-card decks based on the original partner Pokémon, six new cards, and foil reprints of some of the game’s most iconic cards. \nIt also comes with high-end accessories including a foldable game board, magnetic damage counters, and a durable case. Designed for collectors and competitive players, it’s one of the most complete and well-crafted sets the Pokémon Company has released. Sam's Club memberships have been discounted recently, so this could be great shout if you're looking for rare and discounted Pokemon card sets.\n\nIono’s Bellibolt ex Premium Collection\n\n\nThis Premium Collection features Iono’s Bellibolt ex as a full-art foil promo, plus a foil Iono’s Tadbulb card and six booster packs. At $53.23, it’s a modest discount off the typical $55.88 price (for Amazon).\nYou’ll also get standees, a photo sticker, and a backdrop display themed around Iono and Bellibolt. With several playable cards in this set seeing markdowns on the singles market, this box is a good option for collectors or those hoping to pull value.\n\nJourney Together IRs\n\n\nOblivion Gates\n\n\nThis limited edition Oblivion Gates statue from Elder Scrolls IV is available now for pre-order at $39.99. It’s officially licensed, limited to 5,000 units, and includes a display stand in a collectible box.\nThe detailed design captures the fiery gates seen in-game and measures 110 x 76mm. Scheduled to ship in October 2025, this is a good pick for fans of the series looking to add a unique item to their collection.\n\nXCOM Bundle\n\n\nHumble is offering a full XCOM franchise bundle starting at just $10. That unlocks 17 titles, including XCOM 2, Enemy Unknown, Chimera Squad, and multiple DLCs with a combined value of $269.\nThis is a rare chance to pick up nearly the entire series in one package, and part of your purchase supports the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research. Whether you're new to the franchise or filling gaps in your library, it's worth a look.\n\nid & Friends Humble Game Bundle\n\n\nI think calling this a bundle is almost underselling it. You are getting DOOM, Wolfenstein, DOOM Eternal, and a coupon toward DOOM: The Dark Ages, just to name a few. It is a lot of chaos and a lot of catharsis for not a lot of money. Steam ratings are strong across the board if you care about that kind of thing, but honestly, DOOM 1993 still sells itself.\n\nPokémon TCG: Scarlet & Violet - Surging Sparks Booster Bundle\n\n\nSix booster packs in one bundle sounds good on paper, but in my opinion, the smarter move right now is to look at singles. Prices for this set are dropping fast, and if you are chasing specific cards, buying them outright is probably cheaper and less soul crushing than another box full of commons. \n\n\n\nPokémon TCG: Scarlet & Violet—Twilight Masquerade Elite Trainer Box\n\n\nGreninja ex SIR, that is all. In all seriousness, this is a brilliant set that's often overlooked. Whilst the price is a little over MSRP, it's worth getting just for the booster packs included. Plus the promo, sleeves and dice look great in this particular ETB. Following the trend, Twilight Masquerade single cards are also crashing in price, so make sure to check if you can just buy the cards you're after for less.\n\nTwilight Masquerade Single Cards\n\n\nSurging Sparks Single Cards\n\n\nPokémon TCG: Shining Fates Collection Pikachu V Box\n\n\nkachu gets a lot of oversized cardboard love in this box with a promo card, a giant version, and four Shining Fates booster packs. It is a decent pickup if you like opening packs, but single card prices are slipping hard right now. I think it makes more sense to hunt down the exact cards you want unless you are feeling reckless.\n\nShining Fates Single Cards\n\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered Dark Brotherhood Medallion\n\n\nIn my opinion, this is one of those collectibles that you either want immediately or not at all. It is an officially licensed Dark Brotherhood medallion, limited to 5000 pieces, finished in black and gold, and somehow still cheaper than most novelty keychains. Ships later this year, assuming you survive the wait\n\nPokémon TCG Paldean Fates Booster Bundle\n\n\nPaldean Fates brings back shiny Pokémon in a big way, and this bundle gives you six booster packs to chase them. I want to be excited about it, but again, single card prices for Paldean Fates are not holding up well. If you just want a shiny Charizard ex SIR without the suspense, the singles market is sitting there quietly judging your pack opening addiction.\n\nPaldean Fates Single Cards\n\n\nPokemon TCG: Azure Legends Tin - 5 Packs\n\n\nI like a good tin, especially one with five booster packs packed inside, but getting a random Kyogre, Xerneas, or Dialga promo card feels a little like gambling with slightly better odds. It is a solid pickup for the price if you do not mind leaving your promo fate to the RNG gods. If you are only after one specific chase card though outside of the included two Surging Sparks boosters, it might save your blood pressure to just buy it separately.\n\nSurging Sparks Single Cards\n\n\nLexar Sale\n\n\nLexar is finally giving some breathing room on pricing with this Amazon sale, and the Armor 700 is a standout. You are getting 4TB of rugged storage with serious transfer speeds for about 100 dollars off the typical price. It is water resistant, dust resistant, and a lot more durable than whatever junk is sitting at the bottom of your backpack right now.\n\nPokémon Game Sale\n\n\nWoot is offering a solid spread of Pokémon games today, and I want at least three of them. Brilliant Diamond, Legends: Arceus, Let’s Go, Eevee!, and a few others are sitting between $39.99 and $44.99, which feels right for anyone catching up before Switch 2 changes the landscape again. In my opinion, it is a smart time to grab them while prices are behaving themselves. Everything here is fully playable now and will likely get performance bumps once Nintendo's next system arrives.\n\nMSI Desktops & Components Sale\n\n\nMSI’s factory-reconditioned gaming desktops are quietly one of the best parts of today's sale. Machines like the AEGIS R 13NUE-448US are going for $1,129.99, and RTX 4060 GPUs are under $300. I want to be responsible, but this pricing makes it harder than it should be. If you have been thinking about rebuilding your setup, this is exactly the kind of deal you hope not to miss.\n\nSamsung Pro Plus 512GB MicroSDXC + Reader\n\n\nAmazon has the Samsung PRO Plus 512GB microSD card with a USB reader for $29.99. I think it is a good fit if you are adding games to your Switch, Steam Deck, ROG Ally, or anything else still using microSD storage. It is fast enough for quick transfers, big enough for most libraries, and cheap enough that you do not have to think too hard about it. Just know it is not built for Switch 2, in case you're planning ahead.\n\n8BitDo Retro 87 Mechanical Keyboard (Xbox Edition)\n\n\nThe 8BitDo Retro 87 Mechanical Keyboard is down to $99.99 at Amazon. I think it is one of the best-looking keyboards out right now if you want something that works and does not scream “boring office equipment.” \nIt has Kailh Jellyfish X switches, a top-mount design, fast response, and Xbox-inspired styling that actually looks good on a gaming desk. I probably do not need another keyboard. I am thinking about it anyway.\n\nChristian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

Instead, it wants to run the likes of Fortnite through its own mobile store, the Epic Games Store, without Apple and Google getting in the way and gobbling up its profit. Back in 2020, this dispute ended up with Fortnite blocked from release on iOS.\nNow, in the U.S., nearly five years later Fortnite is finally set to return.\n\nIn another tweet, Sweeney hailed the court ruling: “NO FEES on web transactions. Game over for the Apple Tax.\n“Apple’s 15-30% junk fees are now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act. Unlawful here, unlawful there.”\nApple will now be referred to federal prosecutors for violating the U.S. court order. \"Apple’s continued attempts to interfere with competition will not be tolerated,\" U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said. \"This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs once a party willfully disregards a court order.\"\nGonzalez Rogers referred Apple and one of its executives, Alex Roman, vice president of finance, to federal prosecutors for a criminal contempt investigation into their conduct in the case. Roman gave testimony about the steps Apple took to comply with her injunction that was \"replete with misdirection and outright lies,\" the judge wrote.\nApple in a statement said \"we strongly disagree with the decision. We will comply with the court’s order and we will appeal.\"\n\nAfter multiple costly legal battles Epic has now made significant progress; prior to this point its victories were mostly limited to Europe via the region's Digital Markets Act.\nIn August last year, the Epic Games Store launched on iPhones in the European Union and on Android devices worldwide with Fortnite, Rocket League Sideswipe, and Fall Guys for mobile. But actually getting the likes of Fortnite up and running on mobile is a nightmare, with various “scare screens” putting up to 50% of users off, according to Epic.\nThroughout the spending, Epic has suffered significant layoffs. In September 2023, the North Carolina studio saw 830 employees, or about 16% of its workforce, lose their jobs. In October last year, Sweeney insisted the company was now “financially sound,” with Fortnite and the Epic Games Store both hitting new records in “concurrency and success.”\n\nPhotographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images.\nWesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It's about 20 minutes into your Infinity Nikki adventure.\nOpen the Pear-Pal menu by pressing ESC on PC (or the Menu button when using an Xbox controller on PC), the Menu button on PlayStation, or by tapping the Pear-Pal icon in the top-left corner on mobile.\nClick on the gear icon to open the Settings menu.\nScroll over to the Other tab.\nYou’ll see a “Redeem Code” option here. Click on “Apply” and a Redeem Rewards pop-up menu will appear.\nInput your code into the “Enter the redeem code” field and tap “Apply.”\nIf successful, a pop-up will appear showing your free rewards.\n\n\nWhy Isn't My Infinity Nikki Code Working?\nIf the Infinity Nikki code that you're trying to redeem isn't working, it's likely due to one of the following reasons:\n\n\nThere's a typo in the code.\nThe Infinity Nikki code is expired.\n\n\nWhen inputting a code into Infinity Nikki, make sure there are no typos (Os instead of zeroes, capital Is instead of lowercase Ls, etc.) and that there are no accidental spaces before or after the code. If your Infinity Nikki code still doesn't work, it's probably expired and can no longer be redeemed. You'll get a message informing you that the code is wrong if it's expired.\nHow to Get More Infinity Nikki Codes\nThe best way to get more Infinity Nikki codes is to join the official Infinity Nikki Discord server. Once you're in, head to the #self-assign-roles channel and opt-in for the Redeem Code role. You'll receive a notification when a new code is released so you can receive your free rewards ASAP!\nAlternatively, bookmark this Infinity Nikki Codes article, as we update it each time a new code comes out. The Discord server has missed a couple of codes posted to other channels, so we'd recommend checking our article every so often.\nWhat is Infinity Nikki?\nDeveloped by Infold Games, Infinity Nikki is a cozy, open-world RPG. You play as Nikki, as she's whisked away to the world of Miraland, a place where people make Wishes with the help of Stylists. You'll find and create a plethora of outfits and accessories, take on quests, and gather many types of collectibles with the help of Momo, Nikki's adorable feline companion. As you play, you earn Diamonds, which can be spent on Revelation and Resonite Crystals, which are used to pull on the limited time and permanent outfit banners for 5-star and 4-star clothing.\n\nFor Infinity Nikki game help, check out our guides below:\n\nTips and Tricks\nThings to Do First\nInfinity Nikki Resonance Banner Schedule and History\nInfinity Nikki Interactive Map\n\n\nMeg Koepp is a Guides Editor on the IGN Guides team, with a focus on trends.

There’s something about being five Tremors movies deep where all pretense is abandoned, and we all know what we are there for: To watch some ridiculous action and give our brains a break for a bit. La Quimera reminds me a lot of popcorn flicks like that. This FPS is not particularly good-looking, well-written, or innovative. The action doesn’t do anything memorable, and its acting ranges from mediocre to terrible. There is admittedly a certain charm to be found here, especially if you bring a friend or two along to share this rocky ride in co-op. But by nearly every metric, La Quimera is about as good a game as Tremors 5: Bloodlines is a movie. Which is to say it’s not.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ESet in the fictional South American city of Nuevo Caracas, the world is going to hell in a handbasket.

Its levels are very linear, and your objective is almost always to clear enemies as you walk from point A to point B. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as a bit of a throwback like this can be a welcome palate cleanser in a time when wide-open gameplay is increasingly the norm, but it does all start to become a bland blur. That’s because so many areas repeat the same cycle of kill the enemies, open the heavy door, kill the next enemies, open the next heavy door, and so on. There are a handful of encounters that break that trend, most notably an extended gunfight on a slowly rising elevator in a corporate office building, but they are few and far between.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Csection data-transform=\"ignvideo\" data-slug=\"la-quimera-20-minutes-of-4k-60-fps-gameplay\" data-loop=\"\"\u003E\u003C/section\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe gunplay itself is extremely basic, with your weapons effectively limited to a sidearm, shotgun, or rifle.

          "content:encodedSnippet": "Editor's note: La Quimera was originally set to fully release on April 25, but it was unexpectedly delayed that same day. A developer update on April 29 didn't provide a new release date, but did say La Quimera would now be launching in Early Access whenever it did arrive. This announcement came well after our review of what we were initially told would be the full game was largely complete – however, the update post indicates that the content at its new launch will be the same as what we played, so we have decided to publish this as a review of the Early Access version.\n\nI have to admit, I’m a sucker for direct-to-video sequels. There’s something about being five Tremors movies deep where all pretense is abandoned, and we all know what we are there for: To watch some ridiculous action and give our brains a break for a bit. La Quimera reminds me a lot of popcorn flicks like that. This FPS is not particularly good-looking, well-written, or innovative. The action doesn’t do anything memorable, and its acting ranges from mediocre to terrible. There is admittedly a certain charm to be found here, especially if you bring a friend or two along to share this rocky ride in co-op. But by nearly every metric, La Quimera is about as good a game as Tremors 5: Bloodlines is a movie. Which is to say it’s not.\nSet in the fictional South American city of Nuevo Caracas, the world is going to hell in a handbasket. Outside the city walls, some sort of robot apocalypse that’s never really explained is taking place. Inside, there are warring corporations and extreme poverty. That setup isn’t a socio-political commentary so much as a throwback to 80s sci-fi, complete with Power Loader-esque rigs that would look right at home on Ellen Ripley in Aliens.

Making the journey with friends easier is split screen couch co-op, which will be available at launch, as well as an addition that allows players to fast travel to their buddies if someone gets lost.\n\nBorderlands 4 also features a lower chance for Legendary loot drops, dense new skill trees, and so much more. Rep Kit gear will have players choosing between a quick revive and temporary combat buff, while Ordnances give fans the option to fill a cooldown weapons slot with either grenades or unique heavy weapons. There’s also Enhancements, which replace Artifacts in favor of gifting bonuses to guns from specific manufacturers.\nBorderlands 4 recently moved up its PC via the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S release date 11 days from September 23 to September 12. A Nintendo Switch 2 version is due out at an unspecified point later in the year, too.\nDespite speculation from fans, Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford says the scheduled shake up has nothing to do with the long-awaited release date of Take-Two Interactive’s Grand Theft Auto 6. Expect to learn more about Borderlands 4 as we wait for Gearbox to reveal more about its upcoming hands-on gameplay event in June.\n\nMichael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

          "content:encodedSnippet": "Based on the already-popular game series, the Pokémon anime became a cultural phenomenon almost immediately after it was first released in the '90s. A quarter-century later, the franchise is about as long as legendary anime like One Piece.\nUnlike something like One Piece or Dragon Ball, which have a continuous, serialized story, Pokémon is more of an episodic narrative with mostly standalone episodes. Even though there is a progression from series to series, you could theoretically skip around and watch the ones that interest you the most without being completely lost.\nStill, the era of streaming splitting everything up between multiple platforms makes finding (let alone watching) the entirety of Pokémon a mighty task. That's why we're here: to round up where you can watch every Pokémon season and movie online. \nHow Long Is the Pokémon Series? \nThe Pokémon series so far includes over 1300 episodes across 27 seasons. There are also 23 animated Pokémon movies and the live-action Detective Pikachu film. In addition to the streaming links listed below, most of the Pokémon series is available on DVD. \n\n\nHow to Watch Pokémon Online (in Order) \nFor American audiences, the Pokémon series is split across quite a few streaming services. The original series as well as the most recent seasons can be found on U.S. Netflix, while some seasons can be found on free streaming sites like Tubi. Hoopla, which requires a library card but is otherwise free, has a \"Pokémon Bingepass\" that includes Seasons 6-13 of the anime series and is the only way to stream seasons 6-10 online. \nOtherwise, Prime Video has a Pokémon channel add-on for $2.99/month that lets you stream a decent chunk of the series that isn't available elsewhere. Prime Video subscriptions, including the Pokémon channel, offer a seven-day free trial for those trying to watch a specific movie or series for free. Just remember to cancel your subscription before it auto-renews. \n1. Pokémon Indigo League (1997)\nPokémon the Series: Season 1\nThe season that started it all! This one is full of exciting moments, but also rather emotional ones — including a final heartbreak that sets the stage for Pokémon's approach to winning and losing.\nWhere to Stream: Netflix\n2. Pokémon: The First Movie (1998)\nOne of the best Pokémon movies, this is as big a '90s time capsule as they come, with a bangin' soundtrack and some big tear-jerking sequences (\"Brother My Brother\" never fails to hit hard).\nWhere to Stream: You have to rent or purchase this one digitally (see at Prime Video) \n3. Pokémon Mewtwo Strikes Back: Evolution (2019)\n\nA CGI remake of the first movie, it notoriously removes what made the original so endearing, namely, the soundtrack. But it does have more Mewtwo than the U.S. version of the original.\nWhere to Stream: Netflix\n4. Pokémon Adventures in Orange Islands (1999)\nPokémon the Series: Season 2\nA downgrade from the first season, but nevertheless an exciting Pokémon adventure. Here we meet a new companion in Tracy, and the Orange League tournament is one of the show's best.\nWhere to Stream: Prime Video (with Pokémon add-on) or YouTube\n5. Pokémon The Movie 2000 — The Power of One (1999)\nA fascinating villain, world-ending stakes, and some cool visuals make this one of the best Pokémon movies. Plus, it gives Team Rocket arguably their best arc in the whole franchise.\nWhere to Stream: Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on)\n6. Pokémon The Johto Journeys (1999)\nPokémon the Series: Season 3\nThe start of the Gold and Silver series, this one has a very underrated opening song, and a whole new set of Pokémon! It can't be understated how cool it was to see this in 1999, before it became an obvious and expected tradition.\nWhere to Stream: Prime Video\n7. Pokémon 3: The Movie - Spell of the Unown (2000)\nAside from some very dated CGI, this film has an interesting WandaVision-esque cosmic story that's more introspective than the previous two. The relationship between Entei and Molly makes the movie work.\nWhere to Stream: Prime Video (with Pokémon add-on)\n8. Pokémon Johto League Champions (2000)\nPokémon the Series: Season 4\nThe finale of the Johto adventures, this season sees Ash reach the Johto League tournament aka the Silver Conference, with expected results.\nWhere to Stream: Prime Video\n9. Pokémon 4Ever: Celebi- Voice of the Forest (2001)\nTime-travel shenanigans in Pokémon! The movies were already weird before, but this one turns it up to 11 and paves the way for the extremely weird stories to come. \nWhere to Stream: You have to rent or purchase this one digitally (see at Prime Video) \n10. Pokémon Master Quest (2001)\nPokémon the Series: Season 5\nThe end of the original Pokémon franchise, and the first one to be animated digitally, the season features a thrilling fight with Gary.\nWhere to Stream: Prime Video\n11. Pokémon Heroes: Latias and Latios (2002)\nThis movie has a gorgeous Venice-inspired location, an exciting Pokémon race, and a rather bizarre final twist involving shapeshifting. \nWhere to Stream: You have to rent or purchase this one digitally (see at Prime Video) \n12. Pokémon Advanced (2002)\nPokémon the Series: Season 6\nAsh moves to a new region, meets new friends in May and Max, and meets even more new Pokémon after abandoning all his friends (except Pikachu).\nWhere to Stream: Hoopla\n13. Pokémon: Jirachi, Wish Maker (2003)\nThis is where Pokémon start getting terrifying when you stop to think about them. An ancient Pokémon awakens and a kaiju Pokémon is resurrected to cause devastation.\nWhere to Stream: You have to rent or purchase this one digitally (see at Prime Video) \n14. Pokémon Advanced Challenge (2003)\nPokémon the Series: Season 7\nMay's quest to become a Pokémon Coordinator makes for an interesting parallel to Ash's story, putting 10-year-old Ash in a sort of mentor role. At the same time, the Team Magma and Team Aqua subplots are quite entertaining.\nWhere to Stream: Hoopla\n15. Pokémon: Destiny Deoxys (2004)\nThe one where they go to a city based on Vancouver, this movie features an alien Pokémon coming from space to conquer the Earth. This is the kaiju era of the franchise, and it rules.\nWhere to Stream: You have to rent or purchase this one digitally (see at Prime Video) \n\n16. Pokémon Advanced Battle (2004)\nPokémon the Series: Season 8\nThe adventure continues with Ash trying to gather enough medals to enter the Battle Frontier tournament.\nWhere to Stream: Hoopla\n\n17. Pokémon: Lucario and the Mystery of Mew (2005)\nMew is back! And we get one of the best Pokémon of them all in Lucario (fight me). This movie has one of the most emotional climaxes in the franchise.\nWhere to Stream: Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on) \n\n18. Pokémon Battle Frontier (2005)\nPokémon the Series: Season 9\nThe final part of the Advanced seasons is all about the big tournament, with plenty of cool battles and the return of fan-favorite Pokémon.\nWhere to stream: Hoopla\n\n19. Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea (2006)\nWhat if Pokémon did Atlantis: The Lost Empire? Or, more accurately, Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water? The result is a movie full of pirates, environmental themes, and water-themed fun.\nWhere to Stream: Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on)\n\n20. Pokémon Diamond and Pearl (2006)\nPokémon the Series: Season 10\nA vast improvement over the previous season, this time Ash's new Pokémon Coordinator companion, Dawn, is much more developed than May, and we get a fascinating new rival trainer in Paul.\nWhere to Stream: The Roku Channel or Prime Video \n\n21. Pokémon: The Rise of Darkrai (2007)\nThe first part of a fantastic trilogy, this movie is close to being a full-on cosmic horror film. The titular Darkrai is quite Lovecraftian in nature, making for a darker, more sinister movie.\nWhere to Stream: Hulu or Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on) \n\n22. Pokémon Diamond and Pearl: Battle Dimension (2007)\nPokémon the Series: Season 11\nThis is where the dynamic between Ash and Dawn pays off as we see them being challenged in unique ways. Plus, the emergence of Team Galactic raises the stakes and stands apart from previous evil teams.\nWhere to Stream: The Roku Channel\n\n23. Pokémon: Giratina and the Sky Warrior (2008)\nThe second chapter in the trilogy ups the trippy ante, trapping Ash and his friends in a bizarre mirror dimension. Giratina is a terrifying creature, a kaiju-like god of chaos whose ability to manipulate reality elevates it above other Pokémon villains.\nWhere to Stream: Hulu or Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on) \n\n24. Pokémon Diamond and Pearl: Galactic Battles (2008)\nPokémon the Series: Season 12\nTeam Galactic is on the offensive and they threaten to wreak havoc on the Pokémon world. Meanwhile, Ash fights Paul in a thrilling duel that's not just about their skills, but their opposing philosophies about Pokémon.\nWhere to Stream: The Roku Channel\n\n25. Pokémon: Arceus and the Jewel of Life (2009)\nThe end of the movie trilogy goes takes the franchise to a theological place, with Arceus presenting itself as an actual PokéGod. This is a very wild movie, essentially a biblical epic, but with Pokémon, plus there is a lot of time-travel. \nWhere to Stream: Hulu or Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on) \n\n26. Pokémon Diamond and Pearl: Sinnoh League Victors (2010)\nPokémon the Series: Season 13\nTeam Rocket is back! And they are up to no good. Meanwhile, Ash tries to qualify for the Sinnoh League while Dawn trains to compete in the Grand Festival.\nWhere to Stream: The Roku Channel\n\n27. Pokémon Zoroark – Master of Illusions (2010)\n\nAnother movie about trying to control a powerful Pokémon and upsetting the balance of nature, leading to widespread destruction. It's not the most original of the movies.\nWhere to Stream: Hulu or Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on) \n\n28. Pokémon Black and White (2010)\nPokémon the Series: Season 14\nWe have a new land, new Pokémon, and two new companions! Iris and Cilan join Ash on their new adventure as he also encounters Team Plasma — who actually oppose Team Rocket and want to free Pokémon!\nWhere to Stream: Tubi\n\n29. Pokémon the Movie: Black – Victini and Reshiram (2011)\nNow, this is an interesting experiment. Two parts of the same story, the \"Reshiram/Zekrom\" movies, much like the game, feature virtually the same story only swapping out the central Pokémon.\nWhere to Stream: Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on) \n\n30. Pokémon the Movie: White – Victini and Zekrom (2011)\nVirtually the same movie, but rather than Ash encountering Reshiram, he sees the legendary Pokémon Zekrom. There's an island on the verge of destruction, an angry Pokémon, and a world to save.\nWhere to Stream: Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on) \n\n31. Pokémon Black and White: Rival Destinies (2011)\nPokémon the Series: Season 15\nMuch like the Black and White games served as a soft reboot of the game series, so is this season also a reboot of sorts. Sadly, this means Ash is no longer a veteran with a bad track record, but a rookie once again. \nWhere to Stream: Tubi\n\n32. Pokémon the Movie: Kyurem vs the Sword of Justice (2012)\nA rare Pokémon movie that focuses not on the humans, but a critter named Keldeo who wishes to join a Pokémon supersquad. It's a heartfelt story about Pokémon and their goals and dreams.\nWhere to Stream: Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on) \n\n33. Pokémon Black and White: Adventures in Unova and Beyond (2012)\nPokémon the Series: Season 16\nThough they have foiled Team Rocket, there is new danger lurking in the shadows. Meanwhile, Ash is ready to face the Unova League while Iris heads to a Village of Dragons to help inspire her Dragonite.\nWhere to Stream: Tubi \n\n34. Pokémon the Movie: Genesect and the Legend Awakened (2013)\nThe one where Pokémon becomes Jurassic Park. An ancient Pokémon species is resurrected and they immediately start wreaking havoc — until a familiar face arrives to save the day. \nWhere to Stream: Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on) \n\n35. Pokémon XY (2013)\nPokémon the Series: Season 17\nAsh once again trades his companions, this time being joined by the inventor Clemond, his little sister Bonnie, and the Pokémon performer Serena. Together they venture through the Kalos region and encounter numerous new Pokémon.\nWhere to Stream: You have to rent or purchase this one digitally (see at Prime Video) \n\n36. Pokémon the Movie: Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction (2014)\nGreedy collectors try to capture a gem-based Pokémon princess, and only Ash can stop them. It's another movie with a rather basic plot that's been repeated better elsewhere on this list.\nWhere to Stream: Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on) \n\n37. Pokémon XY: Kalos Quest (2013)\nPokémon the Series: Season 18\nThere is a reason this series is considered peak Pokémon. It has a rather heroic portrayal of Ash, some of the best battles in the entire anime, and quite a lot of excitement when it comes to the new Mega Evolutions.\nWhere to Stream: You have to rent or purchase this one digitally (see at Prime Video) \n\n38. Pokémon the Movie: Hoopa and the Clash of Ages (2015)\nAn imp-like Pokémon imprisoned in a bottle is released and starts playing pranks, but his shadow starts growing into a giant evil version of itself. This is one of the most fun Pokémon deities, and reason enough to watch this movie.\nWhere to Stream: Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on) \n\n39. Pokémon XYZ (2013)\nPokémon the Series: Season 19\nTeam Flare makes its move against the legendary Zygarde which is prophesied to destroy all of Kalos. Meanwhile Ash finally competes in the Kalos League Conference.\nWhere to Stream: You have to rent or purchase this one digitally (see at Prime Video) \n\n40. Pokémon the Movie: Volcanion and the Mechanical Marvel (2016)\nA steampunk location gives this movie a unique look that matches the more mechanical Pokémon that are the stars of the show. It also features a villain on a flying fortress war machine, making one cool fantasy movie.\nWhere to Stream: Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on) \n\n41. Pokémon Sun and Moon (2016)\nPokémon the Series: Season 20\nA big departure from the seasons that preceded it, this season boasts a unique art style and a more emotional journey for Ash than we've seen before. This is considered either the pinnacle of the series or a huge letdown, depending on who you ask.\nWhere to Stream: Hulu or The Roku Channel\n\n42. Pokémon Sun and Moon: Ultra Adventures (2017)\nPokémon the Series: Season 21\nAfter 20 years, Pokémon remembers Ash is still a 10-year-old, so he finally goes to school rather than live in the wilderness. Meanwhile, an organization all about Pokémon conservation turns out to be quite shady, and Ash also has visions of legendary Pokémon.\nWhere to Stream: Hulu\n\n43. Pokémon the Movie: I Choose You! (2017)\n\nA loose reboot of the anime's pilot episode, this movie is good for those who want to relive the most iconic moments from the show's early days and those who want to enter the franchise. Also, this is the movie where Pikachu talks, and it is absolutely terrifying.\nWhere to Stream: Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on) \n\n44. Pokémon Sun and Moon: Ultra Legends (2018)\nPokémon the Series: Season 22\nIt's tournament time! But that's not Ash has on his mind, because the Alola region is in danger and it is up to Ash and his friends to save it from destruction.\nWhere to Stream: Hulu\n\n45. Pokémon The Power of Us (2018)\nA continuation of the reboot timeline of I Choose You, this movie is a loose remake of Pokémon: The Movie 2000, just never as good as the original. \nWhere to Stream: Prime Video (with Pokemon add-on) \n\n46. Pokémon Journeys (2019)\nPokémon the Series: Season 23\nThe beginning of the end, with Ash becoming an official Pokémon researcher exploring the wide world of Pokémon.\nWhere to Stream: Netflix\n\n47. Pokémon: Detective Pikachu (2019)\n\nThough not at all part of the official Pokémon order, this is the single best movie in the franchise. The first live-action/animation hybrid, the movie is a hugely entertaining adventure filled with Easter Eggs, and a clear love letter to the franchise.\nWhere to Stream: You have to rent or purchase this one digitally (see at Prime Video) \n48. Pokémon Master Journeys (2020)\nPokémon the Series: Season 24\nThis is where things get very interesting. While Ash is climbing the rankings of the World Coronation Series, he and his friends discover strange occurrences happening in the Galar region, including clones and Pokémon devolving. Stakes don't get higher than literal gods intervening.\nWhere to Stream: Netflix or Prime Video \n\n49. Pokémon Secrets of the Jungle (2020)\nSmall stakes, a more intimate movie, and a Tarzan-like story make this a standout Pokémon movie. In short, it rules.\nWhere to Stream: Netflix\n\n50. Pokémon Ultimate Journeys (2021)\nPokémon the Series: Season 25\nThis is it. The moment of truth. At this point, there's no hiding it, if you aren't aware that Ash Ketchum from Pallet Town becomes the Pokémon World Champion, you've been living under a rock. This is the culmination of nearly a quarter-century's worth of Pokémon, a highly emotional season that reintroduces old friends like Misty and Brock, has some spectacular action animation, the return of a fan-favorite song, and a perfect end to the story of Ash and Pikachu.\nWhere to Stream: Netflix or Prime Video\n\n51. Pokémon Horizons (2023)\nPokémon the Series: Season 26\nAfter saying goodbye to Ash and Pikachu, we meet two new protagonists — Liko and Roy, who are joined by Frede and his companion Captain Pikachu. It's a brand new Pokémon adventure!\nWhere to Stream: Netflix\n\n52. Pokémon Concierge (2023)\n\nOne of the best Pokémon series ever isn't even part of the main story, or even in traditional animation. Instead, this stop-motion show follows Haru as she arrives to work at a Pokémon resort and encounters all kinds of Pokéguests and Pokéemployees.\nWhere to Stream: Netflix\n\n53. Pokémon Horizons – The Search for Laqua (2024)\nPokémon the Series: Season 27\nPart of the appeal of Horizons is that it's a more traditional anime, with an arc-based structure and a bigger focus on adventure. There are mysteries to solve, new challenges, battles, and enemies. \nWhere to Stream: Netflix\nWhat’s Next for the Pokémon Series? \n\nThe second season of Pokémon Horizons, The Search for Laqua, arrived on Netflix this past February. It continues the more recent trend of Pokémon seasons being distinct from the ongoing game generations. We'll likely see a third Horizons season (or even a new series) at some point in 2026. \nMore Pokémon Updates \n\nA lot’s been happening in the world of Pokémon. The next mainline game, Pokémon Legends Z-A, is arriving later this year for Switch and Switch 2. The Pokémon trading card game is bigger than ever, for better or worse. The next TCG expansion, Destined Rivals, releases in just a couple of weeks.

They're perhaps best known for the animation itself, which features a mix of art styles and hand-crafted visual textures. The Spider-Verse movies also feature solid writing, particularly surrounding Miles and his family, as well as great soundtracks. Across the Spider-Verse in particular is a movie I can pretty much watch on a loop without getting bored. \nThe only bad thing I have to say about these movies? They’ve been a pain in the butt to find on streaming. As someone who canceled my Netflix subscription for the new Disney+ and Hulu bundle, I ended up getting both of these movies on Blu-ray. Well, turns out I could have just waited a little longer. \nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse left Netflix on April 26, and starting today, May 1, it has a new streaming home on Disney+. \nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Now Streaming on Disney+ \n\n\n\nThe Spider-Man movie's transition to the Disney-owned streaming service doesn't come as a surprise.

          "content:encodedSnippet": "He's been praised, applauded, mocked, and maligned, but no matter what, Oscar-winner Nicolas Cage has given his everything; pouring his heart and soul into each movie role he's had. Occasionally his go-for-broke creative choices have led him into the heart of Meme Country, but there's no denying Cage's vigorous, explosive talent. \nHe's been in acclaimed rom-coms, soul-crushing dramas, and of course, some of the biggest and best action hits of the 1990s. Nic Cage's resume is so dense in fact, that we've allowed this \"Best Of\" to go to 15, rather than the usual top 10. He's worked with powerhouse directors like David Lynch, Martin Scorsese, Michael Bay, Ridley Scott, and his own uncle, Francis Ford Coppola, turning in some of the most memorable performances in movie history. (Speaking of memorable, be sure to also see the 40 best Nicolas Cage moments written by a Cage superfan who has seen every Nic Cage film.)\nHaving tackled every genre there is in his four decades of acting; whether it's saving San Francisco from a chemical gas attack or heading to Las Vegas for a lethal bender to—well, play himself—in a meta-adventure about his own career, these are our picks for Nicolas Cage's best movies ever.\n\n\n15. Red Rock West (1993)\n\nAfter an impressive debut run in the '80s, Nic Cage's '90s were an eclectic mix of blockbusters, rom-com chaos, and gritty crime dramas—much like Red Rock West, from neo-noir notable John Dahl. Cage played a down-on-his-luck discharged Marine whose search for honest work in Wyoming plunges him into a murder-for-hire mess between Dennis Hopper, J.T. Walsh, and Lara Flynn Boyle. This suspenseful gem featured more of a subdued \"everyman\" performance from Cage, leading him into bigger action hero roles down the line.\n\nWhere to Watch: Unavailable to stream.\n\n14. Kick-Ass (2010)\n\nCage wasn't the headlining star of Matthew Vaughn's Kick-Ass, a full-throttle adaptation of the Mark Millar and John Romita, Jr. comic series, but he stood out in a super-duper supporting role as Big Daddy, the Batman-style vigilante who raised his daughter, Hit-Girl, to be just as violently unforgiving of crime as he was. Cage got to pass his action hero torch to a new crew of young in this pre-MCU hero-verse of Rated R mayhem.\nRead our Kick-Ass review.\n\nWhere to Watch: Stream on Plex, Fawesome, or MovieSphere+, rent on Amazon Prime Video and most platforms.\n\n13. Longlegs (2024)\n\nNicolas Cage seemed to embrace all his crazed passions and eccentricities at once, unleashing an unhinged transformation as a satanic doll maker in Osgood Perkins' surprise hit Longlegs. The story of a haunted FBI agent (Maika Monroe) tracking a series of connected-yet-unexplainable murders was ambitiously accentuated by Cage's performance, which was inspired by everything from Heath Ledger's Joker to falsetto ukulele player Tiny Tim to his own mother. Cage rolled every manic, memed movie scene of his cinematic catalogue into one package for this portrayal of a madman hiding in plain sight.\nRead our Longlegs review.\n\nWhere to Watch: Stream on Hulu, rent on Amazon Prime Video and most platforms.\n\n12. The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent (2022)\n\nNicolas Cage found himself in a bit of a career resurgence in 2022 as recent critical indifference sort of spun full circle into a newfound appreciation as the loopy, delightful film The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent hit theaters and Cage delighted audiences as a pompously sweet version of himself, getting caught up in an comedic espionage adventure after accepting a million bucks to attend a wealthy super-fan’s birthday bash. The film works as an absurdly fun and winking bookend for Cage's career (which isn't over yet, of course).\nRead our The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent Review.\n\nWhere to Watch: Stream on MovieSphere+ or rent on Amazon Prime Video and most platforms.\n\n11. Pig (2021)\n\nCage garnered some of the best reviews of his career, and even some Oscar buzz, for 2021's Pig, the surprisingly moving story about an isolated Oregon truffle-hunter whose beloved pig gets kidnapped. It's a mesmerizing odyssey about love and loss that deftly plays against expectations, reminding us how completely captivating Nic Cage can be in sad, subtle roles.\nRead our Pig review.\n\nWhere to Watch: Rent on Amazon Prime Video and most platforms.\n\n\n10. Con Air (1997)\n\nCon-Air is an absolutely preposterous joy ride from start to finish. As a fast-moving blast-em-up, Con Air keeps its tongue firmly in its cheek as Cage, and his wind blown hair, embody Cameron Poe, an Army Ranger who gets convicted of manslaughter and must hitch a ride aboard a prison transport plane full of the worst criminals imaginable. When John Malkovich's psycho mastermind Cyrus \"The Virus\" Grissom takes over the flight, it puts Poe's plans to reunite with his wife and daughter in danger, causing this terse Terminator to fight back. It's a rambunctious, over-the-top classic.\n\nWhere to Watch: Rent on Amazon Prime Video and most platforms.\n\n9. Wild at Heart (1990)\n\nCage and co-star Laura Dern sizzled and steamed as Sailor and Lula in David Lynch's unbridled romance, Wild at Heart. It's a sultry love-on-the-run dark comedy that allowed Cage and Dern to tap into their craziness while also bringing Chris Isaak's \"Wicked Game\" into heavy rotation on MTV. Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival, Wild at Heart is an insane must-see, as polarizing as a Lynch film can get.\n\nWhere to Watch: Unavailable to stream.\n\n8. National Treasure (2004)\n\nThe first of Cage's two mini-franchises (the other being Ghost Rider), National Treasure was Indiana Jones with United States history. Cage leads as treasure hunter and cryptographer while Benjamin Gates must steal the Declaration of Independence in order to keep hidden gold out of the hands of a crime boss. It's a strong, delightfully dorky family adventure outing for Cage, who dedicated most of his career to the offbeat and outlandish.\nRead our National Treasure review.\n\nWhere to Watch: Stream on Disney+ or rent on Amazon Prime Video and most platforms.\n\n7. The Rock (1996)\n\nThe Rock is one of the purest, most perfect '90s Michael Bay extravaganzas, with Cage and Sean Connery teaming up to thwart domestic terrorists' plans to annihilate the Bay Area. Cage got to mix his quirky indie film comedy chops into an underdog action hero as Stanley Goodspeed, a biochemist in over his head. He's surrounded by actual soldiers meant to protect him and rises to the occasion by becoming a full champion. The Rock, as awesome and grandiose as it was, solidified Cage as a viable player in the realm of mega-movies.\n\nWhere to Watch: Stream on Fubo and MGM+ or rent on Amazon and most platforms.\n\n6. Mandy (2018)\n\nCage's superior, standout film from 2018—that wasn't a voice role in either Teen Titans Go! To the Movies or Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse—was the psychedelic madhouse Mandy. The film is about a peaceful logger, Red, living in the woods of the Pacific Northwest in the '80s, whose life gets horrifically upended by a deranged cult. Red then spirals into surreal rampage of vengeance, armed with with a crossbow and axe. Mandy is artful gonzo violence mixed with feral performances and altered states. It's one of Cage's most triumphant modern flicks.\nRead our Mandy review.\n\nWhere to Watch: Stream on AMC+ or rent on Amazon Prime Video and most platforms.\n\n5. Raising Arizona (1987)\n\nOne of Cage's first starring roles came in one of the Coen Brothers' first feature films, Raising Arizona. As perpetual convict H.I. McDunnough, Cage emanated cartoonish sweetness as he and Holly Hunter's Edwina helped themselves to one of a local couples' newborn pentuplets (Nathan Jr., we think) because the paper said \"they got more than they can handle.\" What follows is the most joyful, rollicking, absurd movie about—er—child kidnapping ever, that both solidified Cage as a formidably funny performer and the Coens as cockeyed craftsmen.\nRead our Raising Arizona review.\n\nWhere to Watch: Rent on Amazon Prime Video and most platforms.\n\n4. Valley Girl (1983)\n\nIn Nic Cage's second-ever movie, he landed his first starring role as one half of a star-crossed rom-com duo. 1983's Valley Girl was key in introducing \"valley\" culture (and \"valleyspeak\") to the rest of America, as Deborah Foreman plays picture-perfect Julie of the materialistic, mall-obsessed San Fernando Valley. You can guess what comes next as Julie falls for the brooding Hollywood punk, Randy (Cage). It's an adorable, amiable, young love story that showcased Cage's charisma and locked him into wonderful romantic lead roles for years following.\n\nWhere to Watch: Rent on Amazon Prime Video and most platforms.\n\n3. Leaving Las Vegas (1995)\n\nNicolas Cage became one of the few, elite performers in the business to win a Best Actor Oscar. Cage was awarded this for Mike Figgis' Leaving Las Vegas, a powerful piece of '90s grime about a man with a sad, singular plan: go to Las Vegas and drink yourself to death. Co-starring Elisabeth Shue (who received a Best Actress nomination), Leaving Las Vegas is a hard, heavy watch, but also a crucial, excellent example of yesteryear indie cinema. It's riveting and dark portrait of self-destruction.\n\nWhere to Watch: Stream on Fubo and MGM+ or rent on Amazon Prime Video and most platforms.\n\n2. Moonstruck (1987)\n\nAt only 22 years old, Nic Cage made a huge, hilarious splash opposite Cher in the Oscar-nominated box office hit, Moonstruck. This instant classic rom-com features Cher as a widow, Loretta, who thinks her love life is cursed, while Cage plays the wily, resentful brother of Loretta's new fiancé. Loretta learns to believe in impulsive, passionate love in this winning, endearing love story that gave us one of Cage's earliest, and best, over-the-top line deliveries. Moonstruck, like Cage himself, is timeless.\n\nWhere to Watch: Stream on The Criterion Channel and The Roku Channel, or rent on Amazon Prime Video and most platforms.\n\n1. Face/Off (1997)\n\nFace/Off is considered by many to be the \"ultimate John Woo movie\" for several reasons. Firstly, it employs all of the director’s Hong Kong cinema hallmarks (double guns, doves, guns drawn on each other, etc.) but it also fully engages in its preposterous premise to the point where you're in, baby. You don't question it for a second and just go along for the insane ride. On top of this, Nic Cage, and co-star John Travolta, were two of the biggest movie stars in the world at the time, and this film squeezes them for all the dopamine delivery they’re worth. These two got to play both hero and villain in the same movie, even unleashing slight impersonations of each other in the process; and for Cage, it was a chance to showcase every operatic ability he brings to the table as an actor.\n\nWhere to Watch: Rent on Amazon Prime Video and most platforms.\n\nUpcoming Nicolas Cage Movies\nNicolas Cage's acting career continues on in earnest with multiple upcoming films.

This eventually leads to an egg sac that looks remarkably similar to one attached to a wall in Alien: Romulus.

Although a classic Xenomorph crawls over the central crate, the fact that we’re getting five different species means the show appears to be expanding the roster of alien creatures in this universe by a wide margin. Could one of them be related to the Predators? That would certainly track with Badlands being set on an alien world where the lead Predator Dek seems to be hunting extraterrestrial monstrosities. Perhaps Elle Fanning’s android was searching for some of the specimens featured in the show? Or maybe one of these monsters will mutate into something we’ll see in Badlands or Killer of Killers. We won’t know for sure until it premieres, but we wouldn’t be surprised if there’s Predator DNA somewhere in Alien: Earth.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Ch2\u003EAlien and Predator’s Long, Intertwined History\u003C/h2\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAlien and Predator have been part of the same world for longer than you might remember. Although the first AVP film was released in 2004, the two space monsters first clashed in a 1989 Dark Horse comic series called Aliens vs. Predator. Predator 2, released the next year in 1990, famously featured an Easter egg referencing Alien by including a Xenomorph skull on the trophy wall of the Predator’s ship. Many other AVP comics and video games were released throughout the ‘90s, cementing the idea of these two creatures having a shared universe long before that idea was popularized in the mainstream by the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Csection data-transform=\"quoteBox\"\u003EWe’re getting five different species in Alien: Earth. Could one of them be related to the Predators?\u003C/section\u003E\u003Cp\u003EHowever, they may have gotten to the trend too early. Although there were two AVP films released in the 2000s, Paul W. S. Anderson’s Alien vs. Predator in 2004 and The Brothers Strause’s Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem in 2007, the series failed to catch on because of poor critical and audience reception (even though they \u003Ca href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl776308225/\"\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emade\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/a\u003E \u003Ca href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl793085441/\"\u003E\u003Cu\u003Emoney\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/a\u003E at the box office). Although serialized superhero and science-fiction blockbusters were starting to take over the world at the time in large part because of a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-episode-1-phantom-menace-25th-anniversary-modern-blockbuster\"\u003E\u003Cu\u003Eseries of trends\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/a\u003E set in place by the Star Wars prequel trilogy, not every franchise in the genre space was given the love and care it needed to last long term. AVP was treated as a B-tier property by 20th Century Fox even though both Alien and Predator had excellent films to their names in the past.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERidley Scott’s original Alien is one of the greatest horror films ever made, James Cameron’s Aliens is among the most iconic movie sequels, and John McTiernan’s original Predator is one of the best action films of the 1980s. Now, we’re not saying AVP needed to aim for an Oscar (or are we?), but few would argue that the two films we received stood up with the best the individual franchises had to offer. The 2010s only made the situation worse with Ridley Scott’s Prometheus series never getting a third entry after the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt2316204/?ref_=bo_se_r_1\"\u003E\u003Cu\u003Ecommercial disappointment\u003C/u\u003E\u003C/a\u003E of Alien: Covenant, and Shane Black’s attempt to rejuvenate the Predator franchise with The Predator falling flat on its face.

Setting both of those films on a contemporary Earth limited their scope considerably, and they struggled to get the audience invested in any of their two-dimensional characters. The films were so rejected by the fanbase that an AVP relaunch could throw those movies out of continuity without any hassles and start over with a clean slate. With Badlands switching up the Predator formula by casting a Predator as the lead character, perhaps Dek (provided he survives Badlands) could be the main hero of a new AVP. As well, another entry in the crossover series could finally expand on the Predalien concept introduced in those films. Maybe some Engineer mutagen could create a being that’s part Alien, part Predator, and part Engineer? Now \u003Cem\u003Ethat\u003C/em\u003E would be terrifying.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EWhatever happens with all of these upcoming projects, both Alien and Predator are in a much healthier state now than they have been in years. Yet that also means that the idea of making a proper crossover film between the two almost certainly has to be on Disney’s radar, especially since an Alien vs. Predator match-up is just about the biggest “event” you can get within this franchise. With cinematic universes and cross-medium integration more popular than ever, a new AVP feels more like a question of when instead of if. Especially with talented filmmakers like Álvarez and Trachtenberg now associated with the property, perhaps these two iconic monsters will finally get the big screen battle they so rightly deserve.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Csection data-transform=\"divider\"\u003E\u003C/section\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003ECarlos Morales writes novels, articles and Mass Effect essays.

Although these projects are not officially connected yet, fans know that Alien and Predator have a long history as part of a shared universe, with the two iconic monsters crossing paths in numerous films, comic books, and video games.\nExamining the latest promotional materials for Predator: Badlands and Alien: Earth may provide clues that Disney is laying the groundwork for a new crossover between Alien and Predator.

The creature is designated “Species 37” (a Mass Effect reference?!) and marked as having unknown DNA by the ship’s computer, MU-TH-UR.

Although a classic Xenomorph crawls over the central crate, the fact that we’re getting five different species means the show appears to be expanding the roster of alien creatures in this universe by a wide margin. Could one of them be related to the Predators? That would certainly track with Badlands being set on an alien world where the lead Predator Dek seems to be hunting extraterrestrial monstrosities. Perhaps Elle Fanning’s android was searching for some of the specimens featured in the show? Or maybe one of these monsters will mutate into something we’ll see in Badlands or Killer of Killers. We won’t know for sure until it premieres, but we wouldn’t be surprised if there’s Predator DNA somewhere in Alien: Earth.\nAlien and Predator’s Long, Intertwined History\nAlien and Predator have been part of the same world for longer than you might remember. Although the first AVP film was released in 2004, the two space monsters first clashed in a 1989 Dark Horse comic series called Aliens vs. Predator. Predator 2, released the next year in 1990, famously featured an Easter egg referencing Alien by including a Xenomorph skull on the trophy wall of the Predator’s ship. Many other AVP comics and video games were released throughout the ‘90s, cementing the idea of these two creatures having a shared universe long before that idea was popularized in the mainstream by the Marvel Cinematic Universe.\nWe’re getting five different species in Alien: Earth. Could one of them be related to the Predators?\nHowever, they may have gotten to the trend too early. Although there were two AVP films released in the 2000s, Paul W. S. Anderson’s Alien vs. Predator in 2004 and The Brothers Strause’s Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem in 2007, the series failed to catch on because of poor critical and audience reception (even though they made money at the box office). Although serialized superhero and science-fiction blockbusters were starting to take over the world at the time in large part because of a series of trends set in place by the Star Wars prequel trilogy, not every franchise in the genre space was given the love and care it needed to last long term. AVP was treated as a B-tier property by 20th Century Fox even though both Alien and Predator had excellent films to their names in the past.\nRidley Scott’s original Alien is one of the greatest horror films ever made, James Cameron’s Aliens is among the most iconic movie sequels, and John McTiernan’s original Predator is one of the best action films of the 1980s. Now, we’re not saying AVP needed to aim for an Oscar (or are we?), but few would argue that the two films we received stood up with the best the individual franchises had to offer. The 2010s only made the situation worse with Ridley Scott’s Prometheus series never getting a third entry after the commercial disappointment of Alien: Covenant, and Shane Black’s attempt to rejuvenate the Predator franchise with The Predator falling flat on its face. But after the success of Prey in 2022 and Alien: Romulus in 2024, Alien and Predator have seen their fortunes turn around.\nAnd now that we’ve seen teases of their upcoming projects, the idea of a new AVP seems closer than ever.\n\nConverging for Carnage\nWe also have to keep in mind that a sequel to Alien: Romulus is currently in development, and that director Fede Álvarez is not just attached to return for that film, but has also outright stated he would be interested in directing an Alien vs. Predator film. Romulus was a big critical and commercial success for Disney, relaunching the franchise after the Prometheus series fell apart while still keeping that part of the brand alive with the Engineer-alike monster in the third act. Cailee Spaeny’s Rain Carradine and David Jonsson’s Andy are currently in stasis heading to Yvaga III, with a direct sequel presumably picking up with those two and their continued voyage in the dark reaches of space. But with Badlands also set in the stars, could we see some cameos or Easter eggs in that film hinting at a Romulus connection?\nIn fact, Álvarez recently said that the best way to do an Alien vs. Predator movie would be to have it be a surprise to audiences:\n“The best AVP will be the one that you don’t know is AVP until the other guy shows up,” the filmmaker recently told Collider. “You think you’re watching a Predator movie, and then they land in some place and there are creatures, and fucking hell, it’s a Xenomorph. That would get me. … Or vice versa, you’re in an Alien movie, and then suddenly a mysterious creature is there, and you can hear that sound, and you see the cloak, and you go, ‘Is that a fucking Predator?’”\n\nÁlvarez coming across excited by the idea of AVP gives us hope that a new take on the mash-up will succeed where the previous ones fell short. Setting both of those films on a contemporary Earth limited their scope considerably, and they struggled to get the audience invested in any of their two-dimensional characters. The films were so rejected by the fanbase that an AVP relaunch could throw those movies out of continuity without any hassles and start over with a clean slate. With Badlands switching up the Predator formula by casting a Predator as the lead character, perhaps Dek (provided he survives Badlands) could be the main hero of a new AVP. As well, another entry in the crossover series could finally expand on the Predalien concept introduced in those films. Maybe some Engineer mutagen could create a being that’s part Alien, part Predator, and part Engineer? Now that would be terrifying.\nWhatever happens with all of these upcoming projects, both Alien and Predator are in a much healthier state now than they have been in years. Yet that also means that the idea of making a proper crossover film between the two almost certainly has to be on Disney’s radar, especially since an Alien vs. Predator match-up is just about the biggest “event” you can get within this franchise. With cinematic universes and cross-medium integration more popular than ever, a new AVP feels more like a question of when instead of if. Especially with talented filmmakers like Álvarez and Trachtenberg now associated with the property, perhaps these two iconic monsters will finally get the big screen battle they so rightly deserve.\n\nCarlos Morales writes novels, articles and Mass Effect essays.

It’s where the craft of the filmmaking team is on full display: Schreier has a bunch of darkly funny stuff on his resume – some of which even leans darker than funny – but my favorite member of the behind-the-scenes team is cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo.

Just look at how he shoots the one-against-many hallway fight in the film’s opening sequence: This is one of the most basic staples of superhero fight choreography, but this time we see it from overhead, with stark black and white shadows stretched all the way across the frame. Even bearing in mind that Marvel films can only modulate their style of action and never completely reinvent it, this is some gorgeous imagery, and it speaks to the isolation Yelena is dealing with throughout the film.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Csection data-transform=\"faceoff\" data-id=\"3728bd96-8b12-4914-9279-2dcaab85d85a\"\u003E\u003C/section\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis is all to say that Thunderbolts* truly excels with its darker, more upsetting subject matter and themes.

Director Jake Schreier and screenwriters Eric Pearson and and Joanna Calo are aiming for a non-stop, snappy back-and-forth in the Guardians of the Galaxy mold, but their main characters don’t live in that energy for nearly as long as they’re meant to – or more, importantly, as long as they need to. Because while Yelena and pals are cracking wise, Thunderbolts*' gloomier half is lurking just out of sight and ready to effectively bum you out.\nThunderbolts* truly excels with its darker, more upsetting subject matter.\nLewis Pullman’s Bob, and his journey to becoming The Sentry, is a story about mental health and extreme loneliness. There are days when Bob feels every bit the invincible Sentry, and days when he can’t help but let The Void take over and wreak havoc. He's the exact right opposition for a character like Yelena, who’s constantly questioning the things she’s done and how she should feel about herself. As Bob forces the members of the Thunderbolts to face the darkest times in their lives, the movie makes its most potent statements about how broken these people really are.\nAnd this is, again, where Thunderbolts* is really at its best. It’s where the craft of the filmmaking team is on full display: Schreier has a bunch of darkly funny stuff on his resume – some of which even leans darker than funny – but my favorite member of the behind-the-scenes team is cinematographer Andrew Droz Palermo. He shot both The Green Knight and A Ghost Story, two movies with very specific visuals speaking to a character's weaknesses and fears. Just look at how he shoots the one-against-many hallway fight in the film’s opening sequence: This is one of the most basic staples of superhero fight choreography, but this time we see it from overhead, with stark black and white shadows stretched all the way across the frame. Even bearing in mind that Marvel films can only modulate their style of action and never completely reinvent it, this is some gorgeous imagery, and it speaks to the isolation Yelena is dealing with throughout the film.\n\nThis is all to say that Thunderbolts* truly excels with its darker, more upsetting subject matter and themes. Because these lows work so well, the highs that don’t quite have the energy they’re aiming for seem that much less high by comparison. And for me, it made the movie overall feel like kind of a bummer. A compelling and moving bummer at times, but I wasn’t really feeling up for a silly round of petty bickering by the time the home stretch rolled around.\nYelena has always been a little anti-Marvel, going back to how she made fun of her sister for being a “poser.” So it’s fitting that at one point in Thunderbolts*, she actually asks “what’s the point?” This is a movie that is low-key wondering “is the MCU too big for a whole two hours dedicated to a collection of side characters like the Thunderbolts?” And the answer is, “actually, yeah.” They are alone. They are the side characters that have to stick up for each other. And they are not The Avengers.\nThis is a movie that wonders “is the MCU too big for a whole two hours dedicated to the Thunderbolts?”\nEven though the climax – which we’ve seen in the trailers – takes place in and around Avengers Tower. Even though a lot of the visuals in that action sequence are pretty clearly meant to evoke the Battle of New York. Even though it references The Avengers’ fakeout working title, Group Hug –this team is not The Avengers. Not yet, at least. And even with bigger MCU events on the horizon, I hope we don’t collectively hold that against them.",
